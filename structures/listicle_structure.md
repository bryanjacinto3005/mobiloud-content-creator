## Key Takeaways
[1 short paragraph, max 3 sentences, summarizing the entire article. Light, low-key mention of MobiLoud in context without being pushy, still focused on the overall takeaway of the article. Strictly no bullet points, pure paragraph in the key takeaways section.]

---

## Introduction
[180 - 220 words. Rich, custom introduction with specific, exclusive stats/hooks (no generic mobile stats). End with a unique soft CTA tailored to the article.]

**Introduction Guidelines:**
- **Length**: 180 - 220 words.
- **Content**: Include stats if possible, but **avoid generic mobile statistics** or overused hooks.
- **Customization**: Understand the article deeply to create a custom intro. Look for stats or hooks that are **exclusive** to the article's specific topic.
- **Avoid**: Repetitive introductions about general mobile app usage.
- **Word Count Verification**:
    - **REQUIRED**: Use the `tools/word_counter.py` script to verify the exact word count of the introduction.
    - **Method**: Save the introduction text to a temporary markdown file and run: `python tools/word_counter.py temp_intro.md`.
    - If the word count is below 180 words, add content to reach the minimum requirement.
    - If the word count is above 220 words, trim content to meet the maximum requirement.
    - Continue rewriting and verifying until the introduction falls within the 180-220 word range.
    - Make sure to delete the temporary intro file once you have verified that the word count requirements are satisfied.
- **Ending the Introduction**:
  - Include a **soft CTA** (e.g., "in this guide...", "in this post, we will tackle...").
  - **Uniqueness**: Never default to a single approach for the last line. The agent must come up with a unique transition/CTA for each article.
