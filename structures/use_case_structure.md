# Platform Use Case Structure

## Metadata

### Meta Title
Format: `How to Build a [Platform] Mobile App` (or similar strong SEO title)
Keep it focused on the core promise: App without rebuilding.

### Meta Description
Focus on: Keep stack + Launch fast + Native experience.
Avoid generic "best app builder" phrasing.

### URL Slug
`[platform]-mobile-app` (preferred) or `convert-[platform]-to-app`

---

## 1. Introduction
**Goal**: Hook the reader by acknowledging the platform's specific strengths (e.g., flexibility, headless, specific industry focus) and introducing the gap (mobile apps).

**Heading Strategy**:
Do not use "Introduction". Use a heading that highlights the specific problem or opportunity.
*   *Inspiration*: `The Gap in Your [Platform] Strategy`, `Why [Platform] Needs a Native App`

**Content Guidelines**:
*   Validate their choice of platform (e.g., "You chose Medusa for flexibility...").
*   Pivot to the problem: Mobile web isn't enough for high-value retention.
*   State the thesis: You can have a native app without destroying your current stack.

---

## 2. The Challenge
**Goal**: Validate the pain. Why is building an app *specifically* for this platform different/harder?

**Heading Strategy**:
Avoid generic "The Challenge" headings. Be specific.
*   *Inspiration*: `Why Building a Mobile App for [Platform] is Difficult`, `The [Platform] Mobile Paradox`, `Why Custom [Platform] Apps Break the Bank`

**Content Guidelines**:
*   **Platform Specifics**: Mention unique architecture (Headless, Plugins, Liquid templates, Blueprint).
*   **The Cost**: Custom/Agency builds ($50k-$200k+).
*   **The Maintenance Trap**: Two codebases = double the work.

---

## 3. Your Options (The Alternatives)
**Goal**: Briefly dismiss the bad options.

**Heading Strategy**:
*   *Inspiration*: `Your Options for Building an App`, `The 3 Paths to Mobile`

**Content Guidelines**:
*   **Option 1: Custom Native**: Expensive, slow, dual maintenance.
*   **Option 2: DIY Builders**: Templates that break your specific [Platform] logic.
*   **Option 3: PWA**: Good for web, but not an "App Store" presence (usually).

---

## 4. The Solution (MobiLoud)
**Goal**: Introduce the "better way" that specifically answers the challenges above.

**Heading Strategy**:
*   *Inspiration*: `A Better Way to Build Your [Platform] App`, `Turn Your [Platform] Store into an App`, `The Solution: [Platform] + MobiLoud`

**Content Guidelines**:
*   **The Concept**: "Hybrid" or "Composite" - using the web stack in a native shell.
*   **Key Distinction**: It uses *your* real site, so it works.
*   **The Benefit**: Zero redundant work.

---

## 5. Why [Platform] + MobiLoud (The Fit)
**Goal**: Make it specific. Why is this specific pair a match made in heaven?

**Heading Strategy**:
*   *Inspiration*: `Why MobiLoud is Built for [Platform]`, `Seamless Integration with Your [Platform] Stack`

**Content Guidelines**:
*   **No Rebuild**: Crucial for complex/custom setups.
*   **Real-time Sync**: Admin changes reflect instantly.
*   **Integrations**: Mention specific platform tools (e.g., "Works with your [Specific Plugin/Tool]").

---

## 6. Feature Spotlight
**Goal**: If the platform has unique, complex features (like Elastic Path's PXM or Medusa's multi-region), dedicate a section to explaining how we handle them.

**Heading Strategy**:
*   *Inspiration*: `No Compromises: Handling [Platform] Specifics`, `Does [Specific Feature] Work on Mobile?`

**Content Guidelines**:
*   Pick 2-3 platform features.
*   Explain "Native vs MobiLoud" for each. (Native = hard rebuild, MobiLoud = works out of the box).

---

## 7. The Process
**Goal**: Show speed and ease.

**Heading Strategy**:
*   *Inspiration*: `From [Platform] to App Store in Weeks`, `How to Launch in Under 30 Days`

**Content Guidelines**:
*   **Step 1**: Demo/Consult.
*   **Step 2**: Config/Branding.
*   **Step 3**: Testing (on real devices).
*   **Step 4**: Submission (we handle it).
*   **Step 5**: Launch/Maintenance.

---

## 8. FAQs
**Goal**: Answer platform-specific technical fears.

**Heading Strategy**:
*   *Inspiration*: `Frequently Asked Questions`, `Common Questions from [Platform] Users`

**Content Guidelines**:
*   Will my [Specific Checkout] work? (Yes).
*   What about [Specific Plugin]? (Yes).
*   Is this a PWA? (No, it's native).

---

## 9. CTA
**Goal**: Drive the demo.

**Heading Strategy**:
*   *Inspiration*: `Ready to Launch?`, `Get a Preview of Your App`

**Content Guidelines**:
*   Link to `/book-demo`.
