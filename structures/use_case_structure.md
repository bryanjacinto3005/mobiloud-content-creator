# Use Case Article Structure

> **Purpose**: This is a reusable template for creating platform-specific use case articles. Each section contains instructions and expectations—not final content. Replace `[Platform]` with the target platform name (e.g., VTEX, Spryker, Medusa).

> **IMPORTANT - Headings**: The headings shown in this structure (e.g., "The Challenge", "The Solution") are **structural placeholders only**. Do NOT copy them verbatim. Do NOT simply pick one from the "Example Patterns" list. You must **invent a new, unique heading** that fits the specific context of the article. The examples provided are **strictly for inspiration only** to demonstrate the *type* of heading required, not a bank of options to select from.

## Metadata
Meta Title: [SEO-optimized title, typically "How to Build a Mobile App for Your [Platform] Site" with optional subtitle]
Meta Description: [150-160 characters focusing on building an app, leveraging existing site, MobiLoud as solution]
URL Slug: [platform-mobile-app or platform-mobile-apps, lowercase, hyphenated]

---

## Introduction (No H2 Heading in Final Article)

[3-5 short paragraphs. Hook the reader, set up the problem-solution arc, and end with a clear preview/CTA. No heading in the final output—this content appears directly after the title.]

**Introduction Guidelines**:
1.  **Validate**: Briefly praise the platform choice (e.g., "Choosing [Platform] shows you value [Platform Benefit]...").
2.  **Pivot**: Shift to the specific challenge of building a mobile app for this platform (cost, complexity).
3.  **Promise & Preview**: The final paragraph must be a direct CTA/Preview using phrases like "In this guide, you'll learn..." or "This guide will show you how to..." covering the solution (MobiLoud).

*Note: Adapt the tone to the platform (Enterprise = efficient; DTC = brand-focused).*

## [The Challenge Section]

**Heading Guidance:**
- Do NOT use "The Challenge" as the final heading
- Create a unique heading that captures the platform-specific difficulty
- **Example Patterns (Do NOT use these exact headings. Invent your own based on these ideas):**
  - "The Challenge: Why Building an App for [Platform] is Inherently Difficult"
  - "Why Building a [Platform] App is Inherently Difficult"
  - "The [Platform] Mobile Paradox"

**Purpose**: Validate the pain point and establish why traditional app development doesn't work well for this platform.

**What to Include:**
- Explain what makes [Platform] unique (headless, composable, API-first, custom, etc.)
- Clarify why simple app builders don't work for this platform
- List the pain points of traditional native development:
  - **High Costs**: $100,000 - $500,000+ for custom native apps
  - **Long Timelines**: 6-12+ months for development
  - **Complex Integrations**: Rebuilding all features and API connections
  - **Ongoing Maintenance**: Perpetual dual-codebase management

**Format**: 2-4 paragraphs with a bulleted list for pain points.

**Tone**: Problem-aware but not doom-and-gloom. Set up the need for a better solution.
