## Key Takeaways
[1 short paragraph, max 3 sentences, summarizing the entire article. Light, low-key mention of MobiLoud in context without being pushy, still focused on the overall takeaway of the article. Strictly no bullet points, pure paragraph in the key takeaways section. Keep the heading title as Key Takeaways]

---

## Introduction
[180 - 210 words. Rich, custom introduction with specific, exclusive stats/hooks (no generic mobile stats). End with a unique soft CTA tailored to the article. Keep the heading title as Introduction]

**Introduction Guidelines:**
- **Length**: 180 - 210 words.
- **Content**: Include stats if possible, but **avoid generic mobile statistics** or overused hooks.
- **Customization**: Understand the article deeply to create a custom intro. Look for stats or hooks that are **exclusive** to the article's specific topic.
- **Avoid**: Repetitive introductions about general mobile app usage.
- **Word Count Verification**:
    - **REQUIRED**: Use the `tools/word_counter.py` script to verify the exact word count of the introduction.
    - **Method**: Save the introduction text to a temporary markdown file and run: `python tools/word_counter.py temp_intro.md`.
    - If the word count is below 180 words, add content to reach the minimum requirement.
    - If the word count is above 210 words, trim content to meet the maximum requirement.
    - Continue rewriting and verifying until the introduction falls within the 180-210 word range.
    - Make sure to delete the temporary intro file once you have verified that the word count requirements are satisfied.
- **Ending the Introduction**:
  - Include a **soft CTA** (e.g., "in this guide...", "in this post, we will tackle...").
  - **Uniqueness**: Never default to a single approach for the last line. The agent must come up with a unique transition/CTA for each article.

## [H2 Heading 1]
[Main point or section idea.]

**General Heading & Structure Rules:**
- **Heading Hierarchy**:
  - **No H2 to H3 jumps**: Do not go straight from an H2 to an H3.
  - **Introductory Text**: Always include some text (e.g., a paragraph) beneath an H2 before starting an H3 subsection.
- **Paragraphs**: Keep paragraphs short: roughly 2–4 lines. Use transitions and connectors.

**Competitor Selection Guidelines:**
- **Avoid**: Vajro, Superfans (unless explicitly required by the topic).
- **Prefer**: Appbrew, StoreLab (if they fit the context of the article).
- **Rationale**: We have stronger partnerships with Appbrew and StoreLab.

    - Benefits or advantages
    - Comparison points
    - Sets of related items

- **Bullet Rules**:
    - Use bullets liberally (when in doubt, use bullets).
    - Keep bullet items concise (5-12 words ideal).
    - Start bullets with parallel structure.
    - **Pre-Publish Checklist**: Scan for any sentence listing 3+ items and convert to bullets.

## Table Placement & Guidelines
**Tables should appear in the middle or bottom portions of articles, NOT at the very beginning for blogposts.**

- **Placement**: Tables work best after you've established context and narrative flow. **Do not put tables immediately after the introduction.**
- **Bridge Paragraph**: When including a comparison table, add a short, plain-language bridge paragraph immediately before the table that sums up the core difference in one or two sentences. Also add a descriptive heading title for the table.
