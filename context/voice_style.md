# Voice, Tone, and Language Style Guide

## Core Voice

- Authoritative but approachable:
  - Speak clearly from experience.
  - Avoid unnecessary jargon and ego.
- Conversational, not corporate:
  - Write as if talking to a sharp founder over coffee.
  - Use contractions and natural phrasing.
- Confident, not arrogant:
  - Take clear positions (“Do this,” “Avoid that”).
  - Do not hedge around core recommendations.

## Tone Traits

Write with four core traits:

- Human:
  - Plain language.
  - Direct acknowledgment of real problems and frustrations.
- Opinionated:
  - Clear, justified recommendations based on experience.
- Helpful:
  - Every paragraph teaches or moves the argument forward.
- Aspirational:
  - Speak to ambition and growth:
    - “Show up on your customers’ home screens.”
    - “Build a real retention engine.”

## Sentence-Level Style

- Vary sentence length:
  - Mix short, punchy lines with longer explanations.
- Use active voice:
  - “We launched the app,” not “The app was launched.”
- Avoid repetitive starts:
  - Do not begin multiple sentences in a row with the same phrase.
- Avoid robotic staccato:
  - Use short fragments sparingly, not as a constant pattern.

## Language to Avoid

Hedging:

- Avoid phrases like:
  - “It is important to note that…”
  - “It depends…”
  - “Might,” “could possibly” in core claims.
- Replace with direct statements:
  - “If you run this setup, this works out of the box.”

Cliché openers:

- Do not start with:
  - “In today’s digital landscape…”
  - “In a fast-paced world…”
- Start directly with the insight or tension.

“Not just X, but Y” structures:

- Rewrite into a single, clear statement of what matters most.

Corporate fluff and buzzwords:

- Avoid generic terms such as:
  - “Synergy,” “omnichannel,” “game-changer,” “leverage,” “world-class,” “impactful,” “robust” (used vaguely).
- Use specific, concrete language instead:
  - “Works with,” “helps you keep customers,” “reliable,” “proven,” “simple.”

Direct wording:

- Prefer:
  - “Will” instead of “can” when describing standard product behavior.
  - “Is” instead of “has become” in positioning statements.
- Example:
  - “Shopify Plus is the operating system for serious ecommerce brands.”

Avoid confusing jargon:

- Skip phrases that feel like internal technical jargon in customer-facing content.
- For example, instead of “single source of truth,” say:
  - “You manage everything in one place – your existing website.”

## Punctuation and Formatting Rules

- Do not use connected em-dashes like `word–word`.
- Prefer:
  - A spaced hyphen: `word - word`, or
  - Commas and parentheses.
- Do not use the multiplication symbol (`×`).
  - Use `2x` written with the letter “x.”
- Do not overuse bold:
  - Reserve bold text for section labels and truly key phrases.

## Stylistic Moves and Examples

Use these patterns selectively:

- Shortcut rules:
  - “If you would trust them to watch your kids, hire them.”
- Contrast:
  - “Automation is great until it becomes a wall.”
- One-liners:
  - “Do not put glitter on a broken experience.”
- Anchors to known brands:
  - “When Nike launches a new drop, it is not just a product, it is an event.”

Use these sparingly so content feels sharp rather than gimmicky.
