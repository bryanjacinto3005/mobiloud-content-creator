# Content & Messaging Guidelines: Things to Avoid

## Metadata
*   **Subject:** Negative Constraints & Guidelines
*   **Audience:** Writers, AI Agents
*   **Goal:** Prevent common messaging mistakes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Creative Application:** When using examples from this document in blog posts, **do not copy them verbatim**. Be creative and adapt the concepts to your current blog post's context using your own words. This prevents repetitive language across different articles and ensures each piece feels fresh and unique.

## 1. Overall Positioning

### Do Not Rebuild
*   **Avoid:** Implying the customer needs a new website.
*   **Say:** "We use your existing site as the foundation."

### Emphasize What They Already Have Works
*   **Context:** When discussing "rebuilding" or "reinventing" a store, remember that any decent store has likely spent significant time optimizing their website—tweaking category pages, product layouts, cart drawers, homepage, navigation, etc. These changes drive conversions and revenue.
*   **Avoid:** Glossing over the value of their existing optimizations.
*   **Say:** "The rebuild approach means you lose all that optimization work. With MobiLoud, you carry it all over—every tweak, every tested change that drives more conversions."
*   **Key Point:** This is a significant advantage that differentiates MobiLoud from solutions that require starting from scratch.

### Do Not Focus Only on Conversion
*   **Avoid:** Framing the app *only* as a conversion tool (mobile web is getting better at this).
*   **Say:** Focus on **Retention**, **LTV**, and **Repeat Purchases**.

### Do Not Use "Wrapper" or "Container" Terminology
*   **Avoid:** Words like "wrapper," "wrapping," "container," "native container," or "hybrid" (unless technical context requires it).
*   **Avoid Phrases:** "Wraps your website," "puts your site in a container," "just a shell."
*   **Say:** "Converts your site into an app," "Runs your website as a native app," "Full-featured mobile app," "Native app experience," "Transforms your site."
*   **Rationale:** "Wrapper" and "container" imply low quality, simplicity, and a lack of true native utility. We want to emphasize the resulting value (a native app) rather than the technical mechanism.

### Clarify the Transition
*   **Avoid:** "Website to mobile services" (sites are already mobile-friendly/responsive).
*   **Say:** "Website to app."

### Do Not Address Non-ICP Personas
*   **Avoid:** "If you are a startup..." or "If you have zero budget..." or "If you are playing a game..."
*   **Context:** Our readers are established brands. Addressing irrelevant personas (students, startups, developers) dilutes the message and suggests the article might not be specifically for them.
*   **Action:** Assume the reader is a qualified decision-maker at an established brand. Speak directly to their situation.

---

## 2. Platform Association & Positioning

### Avoid Over-Associating with WordPress
*   **Avoid:** Positioning MobiLoud as primarily a "WordPress tool" or "WordPress app builder."
*   **Context:** MobiLoud used to be cheaper and primarily targeted WordPress sites (blogs, news sites). We're positioned differently now—targeting established ecommerce brands at a premium price point.
*   **Say:** "Established brands," "Ecommerce brands," "Growing brands."
*   **Example:** Instead of "Best for established WordPress and WooCommerce brands," say "Best for established brands" or "Best for established ecommerce brands."
*   **Rationale:** A lot of content on the internet and in AI training data still mentions us as a WordPress tool, but this no longer aligns with our target customer profile or premium positioning.

### Downplay WooCommerce Association (To a Lesser Extent)
*   **Avoid:** Over-emphasizing WooCommerce as the primary platform we serve.
*   **Context:** While WooCommerce is closer to our positioning than WordPress, WooCommerce stores are often lower-tier and not in our ideal customer profile.
*   **Say:** When mentioning platforms, either keep it general ("your existing site," "your ecommerce platform") or mention multiple platforms together ("Shopify, WooCommerce, or custom builds").
*   **Rationale:** We can technically work with WordPress and WooCommerce brands, but it's not ideal and not what we want to emphasize in our marketing.

### Emphasize Ecommerce & Premium Positioning
*   **Focus On:** Established ecommerce brands, serious stores, brands generating significant revenue.
*   **Say:** "Premium solution for established brands," "Enterprise-level features without the enterprise price tag," "For brands serious about mobile commerce."
*   **Avoid:** Language that suggests we're a budget option or starter tool for bloggers or small WordPress sites.
*   **Frame:** Position MobiLoud as the choice for brands that have outgrown template builders and DIY solutions.

---

## 3. Structure & Flow

### Get to the Point
*   **Avoid:** Long, fluffy intros.
*   **Action:** Cut the preamble. Start with the value proposition.

---

## 4. Competitors

### Be Careful Naming Names
*   **Avoid:** Explicitly naming competitors unless necessary for a direct comparison case study.
*   **Say:** "Generic SaaS tools," "DIY builders," "Agencies."

---

## 5. Pricing & Costs

> [!NOTE]
> **MobiLoud Pricing Only:** The guidelines in this section about avoiding specific numbers apply **only to MobiLoud's pricing**. When discussing other tools or platforms in the article, it is acceptable—and often helpful—to mention their explicit plans and pricing.

### Clarify the Model
*   **Avoid:** Making it sound like a one-time fee.
*   **Say:** "Setup fee + Monthly subscription."

### Avoid Specific Numbers (MobiLoud Only)
*   **Avoid:** "It costs exactly $500."
*   **Say:** "Starts from a few hundred per month," "Low four figures upfront."

### Default to the "Growth" Standard
*   **Avoid:** Using the cheapest "Startup" plan as the anchor.
*   **Say:** Frame value around the **Growth** plan (most popular for serious brands).

### Shopify App Builder Pricing Reality
*   **Avoid:** Understating the cost of Shopify app builder alternatives (outdated figures like $200-400/mo).
*   **Reality:** Leading Shopify app builders are increasingly raising prices and adding performance fees based on revenue percentages.
*   **State:** For a mid-market brand, the typical range with one of these leading solutions is **$600-1,500/mo** when factoring in base subscriptions + performance fees.
*   **Rationale:** This reflects a more accurate competitive landscape and prevents undervaluing MobiLoud's pricing position.

### Update Custom Agency Pricing Expectations
*   **Avoid:** Quoting outdated ranges like "$50,000 – $150,000" for custom agency builds.
*   **Say:** "Custom agency apps typically cost between **$150,000 and $450,000** upfront."
*   **Rationale:** Low estimates do not reflect the true cost of premium agency work in 2026. Use the higher range to highlight the massive investment required for custom development.

---

## 6. Timelines

### Under-Promise
*   **Avoid:** "Launch in 2 weeks!" (Too risky).
*   **Say:** "Launch in ~30 days" or "around 4 weeks."

---

## 7. Claims & Accuracy

### Push Notifications
*   **Avoid:** "Everyone sees push notifications."
*   **Say:** "Push notifications are seen by almost everyone *who has the app installed*."

---

## 8. Content Prioritization

### Lead with Major Customer Objections
*   **Avoid:** Placing minor or niche points high in lists or early in content.
*   **Say:** Address the most common objections first (e.g., "I don't need an app" / "My website is enough").
*   **Example:** Don't lead with comparisons to the "Shop" app—most brands aren't thinking about this. Save minor points for later in the content.

---

## 9. Performance & Technical Claims

### Avoid Contradicting Our Solution
*   **Avoid:** Claiming "mobile web is slow" or has "performance ceilings" when our apps run the website inside the app.
*   **Say:** Focus on legitimate mobile web issues that apps solve:
    *   UI clutter (tabs, address bars)
    *   Distractions and lack of focus
    *   Tracking difficulties (cookies being blocked)
    *   Difficulty retaining web visitors

### Use Softer Competitive Language
*   **Avoid:** Aggressive or combative language when discussing competitor limitations.
*   **Example:** "Most app builders have no idea what to do with headless. They cannot 'read' your site because it is not a standard Shopify theme."
*   **Say:** "Most app builders are not compatible with headless builds."
*   **Rationale:** Softer, factual language maintains professionalism and focuses on technical limitations rather than implying incompetence. It positions us as helpful experts rather than aggressive competitors.

### Be Accurate About Checkout & Friction
*   **Avoid:** Claiming our checkout solves problems that don't exist (e.g., Apple Pay/Google Pay are already on mobile websites).
*   **Say:** Our checkout experience mirrors the mobile website, so if there's friction there, it exists in the app too.
*   **Focus On:** The real advantage—**abandoned cart push notifications**. These are the #1 way to recover abandoned carts and cut into high abandonment rates.

### Frame Conversion Rates Accurately
*   **Avoid:** Saying higher conversion is "the most compelling financial argument."
*   **Say:** The most compelling metric is **revenue per user** (app users can generate 10x higher revenue than mobile web shoppers).
*   **Explain Why Apps Convert Better:**
    *   App shoppers are your best customers
    *   Apps get them coming back more often (force multiplier for your most valuable customers)
    *   Apps keep them engaged longer (longer sessions, more products viewed, fewer distractions)
    *   Small but significant UI differences (no browser tabs, dedicated tab bar, mobile navigation)
*   **Avoid:** Claiming pre-loaded experiences, saved payment details, or pre-filled addresses as unique advantages—remember, the website IS the app.

### Explain AOV Increases Correctly
*   **Avoid:** Saying apps are "less clunky" than mobile sites or that clunky browsing is the problem.
*   **Say:** Apps increase AOV through **fewer distractions** and **longer engagement**.
*   **Focus On:** Apps keep users engaged longer (see session time in benchmark reports), which naturally leads to more products viewed and higher AOV.

### Don't Claim Apps "Lower CAC"
*   **Avoid:** Saying apps will "lower your customer acquisition costs."
*   **Reality:** It still costs the same to acquire a customer from ads or email.
*   **Say:** Apps **increase LTV without increasing CAC**. For the same acquisition cost, you get more revenue.
*   **Frame:** Apps reduce the **impact** of rising CAC, rather than directly lowering it.

### Avoid Overstating UX Friction Differences
*   **Avoid:** Claiming mobile sites "lag," "require constant reloading," or have inherent performance issues.
*   **Reality:** If the website is slow, the app will be slow too (the website IS the app).
*   **Say:** The main UX benefit is **one-tap access from the home screen**—small but significant.
*   **Avoid:** Promising biometric login (FaceID/TouchID) as a standard feature—this requires native device integrations that aren't part of our regular offering.

---

## 10. Email & SMS Messaging

### Position Push Notifications as Complementary
*   **Avoid:** Framing email and SMS as "not working," "too expensive," or ineffective.
*   **Say:** "Email and SMS aren't enough" or "Push notifications fill the gaps."
*   **Rationale:** Brand owners agree email and SMS are valuable channels. Don't be anti-email or anti-SMS.
*   **Mention:** These channels are getting harder:
    *   Emails filtered to promotions tab
    *   SMS filtering (iOS 26 and beyond)
    *   Rising costs as lists grow
*   **Frame:** Push notifications supplement email and SMS, helping round out the retention stack.

---

## 11. Third-Party Tools & Sentiment

### Stay Neutral on Tools Like Klaviyo
*   **Avoid:** Assuming all brand owners "love" specific tools.
*   **Say:** Acknowledge the tool is powerful and necessary, but recognize mixed feelings about costs.
*   **Example:** Instead of "You likely love Klaviyo," say "Klaviyo is a powerful tool, but as your list grows, so does your monthly bill."

---

## 12. Language & Tone

### Project Confidence with "Will" Not "Can"
*   **Avoid:** Using tentative language like "can" when describing what MobiLoud does.
*   **Example:** "If an extension or integration works on your mobile website, it **can** work in the app as well."
*   **Say:** "If an extension or integration works on your mobile website, it **will** work in the app as well."
*   **Rationale:** "Can" suggests uncertainty and that something "might" work. "Will" projects confidence and certainty in our solution.

### Use Direct Language ("Is" vs "Has Become")
*   **Avoid:** Using indirect phrases like "has become" when making statements about platforms or products.
*   **Example:** "Shopify Plus **has become** the operating system for serious ecommerce brands."
*   **Say:** "Shopify Plus **is** the operating system for serious ecommerce brands."
*   **Rationale:** Direct language sounds more confident and makes content stronger. It positions statements as facts rather than recent developments.

### Clarify "Single Source of Truth" Messaging
*   **Avoid:** Using technical jargon like "single source of truth" in customer-facing content when it doesn't fit the context naturally.
*   **Example:** "It starts from a simple assumption. The existing mobile site is already the single source of truth."
*   **Say:** "It starts with a simple assumption: your existing mobile website is already good enough. The goal should not be to try and recreate it, but to convert it into a native app, while keeping everything that works."
*   **Rationale:** Clear, direct language is more accessible and emphasizes the value proposition—no need to rebuild what already works.

### Consistent Spelling for "ecommerce"
*   **Avoid:** "e-commerce", "eCommerce", "E-commerce" (unless consistent with a specific brand name).
*   **Say:** "ecommerce" (all lowercase, no hyphen).
*   **Rule:** Use "Ecommerce" only at the start of a sentence.

### Avoid Over-Dramatization
*   **Avoid:** Using emotionally charged terms like "horror stories" or "nightmares" to describe technical hurdles or industry stigmas.
*   **Rationale:** It makes the approach sound inherently dangerous rather than just requiring correct execution.
*   **Say:** "Common concerns," "threads about rejection," "risks."

---

## 13. Social Proof

### Verify References
*   **Avoid:** Using churned customers as examples.
*   **Action:** Always check if the brand is still a live MobiLoud customer before citing them.

### Case Study Breadth
*   **Guideline:** It is okay to focus on a single deep-dive example if it fits the narrative.
*   **Encouragement:** You are encouraged to follow the example with a link to the broader portfolio (e.g., "See more case studies...").
*   **Rationale:** Shows the success is repeatable without cluttering the article with too many details.

> [!WARNING]
> **Critical Rule:** If you are unsure if a claim is true, **do not write it**. It is better to be vague than wrong.

## 14. Article Structure & Format

### Key Takeaways Formatting
*   **Format:** Single paragraph only. NO bullet points.
*   **Length:** Maximum 70 words.
*   **Rationale:** This section must be a quick, punchy summary for the reader to glance at before diving in. Long lists defeat the purpose.

### Introduction Flow (For Product Comparison/Review Articles)
*   **Avoid:** Jumping too quickly into TCO, hidden costs, or complex concepts right away.
*   **Structure:** Follow a natural progression:
    1. Acknowledge the need/desire (e.g., "You want to launch a mobile app")
    2. Acknowledge cost concerns (e.g., "Of course, cost is always a factor. The less money you have to spend, the more profit you keep")
    3. Mention available affordable options (e.g., "The good news is there are plenty of affordable options available")
    4. Set expectations for the content (e.g., "We're going to rank them in this post—but we're also going to explain why there's more to affordability than the sticker price")
*   **Rationale:** This builds context gradually, meets the reader where they are, and prepares them for deeper concepts without overwhelming them upfront.

### Simplify the Introduction Hook
*   **Avoid:** Convoluted logical jumps (e.g., "You hit a conversion ceiling" -> "Apps improve retention"). Mixing these metrics early on feels clunky.
*   **Action:** Start directly with the user's intent.
*   **Example:** "If you want to launch an app and your site is already optimized, a webview approach is the most efficient way."

### Product/Tool Descriptions
*   **Avoid:** Using only one or two sentences to describe competing products or tools.
*   **Action:** Expand product sections into a few sentences explaining the core details about the tool—what it is, who it's for, what makes it different.
*   **Rationale:** Readers appreciate enough context to make informed comparisons, and fuller descriptions build credibility.

### Revenue Share & Pricing Transparency
*   **Avoid:** Using language that implies competitors might be hiding something (e.g., "no publicly listed revenue share").
*   **Action:** If there's no revenue share mentioned or available, simply state "no revenue share" without qualification.
*   **Rationale:** Keeps the tone neutral and factual without casting shade unnecessarily.

### Tone When Discussing Limitations
*   **Avoid:** Using overly critical or negative language when describing free tiers or competitor limitations (e.g., "Severe Limits on Free Plan: You won't get the features you need to actually drive growth").
*   **Say:** Keep language light, neutral, and non-critical. Instead of saying a free plan is "quite limited" or has "severe limits," say it's "essentially a preview" or "good for testing."
*   **Rationale:** Maintains a professional, helpful tone rather than sounding competitive or dismissive.

### Avoiding Marketing Jargon in Copy
*   **Avoid:** Using phrases like "positioned as" when describing products or pricing (e.g., "It isn't positioned as a $49/month DIY tool").
*   **Say:** Use direct, clear language (e.g., "It's not a $49/mo tool").
*   **Rationale:** Clearer, more confident, and less like marketing speak.

### Listicle & Comparison Formatting
*   **Format:** When listing options (e.g., "Top 5 Alternatives"), group them under a clear parent H2.
*   **Hierarchy:** Use H2 for the section title (e.g., "The Top 5 Shopney Alternatives") and H3 for each individual item (e.g., "1. MobiLoud").
*   **Rationale:** Improves scanability and SEO hierarchy.

---

## 15. Competitor Pricing & Market Analysis

### Generalize the Market Landscape
*   **Avoid:** Listing specific competitor names (e.g., Tapcart, Shopney, Vajro) in introductions or general market summaries.
*   **Say:** "Shopify app builders," "DIY platforms," "The market."
*   **Rationale:** Focus on the *category* (DIY builders) and its inherent limitations (hidden labor, maintenance) rather than specific competitor comparisons.

### Focus on the "Hidden" Reality
*   **Avoid:** Implying the subscription fee is the only cost or simply listing sticker prices.
*   **Say:** Emphasize the "hidden costs" that DIY builders ignore:
    *   Team time to design and manage the app.
    *   Integration configuration and maintenance.
    *   Campaign strategy.
    *   Risk of a poor result despite the tool being "easy."

### Critiquing Category Limitations
*   **Avoid:** Linking universal category flaws to a single specific competitor (e.g., "Builders like Shopney are rigid").
*   **Say:** "Template-based builders are rigid."
*   **Rationale:** Critique the *method* (templates), not the *brand*. This is more objective and less aggressive.

---

## 16. Comparison & Listicle Articles (Agencies/Builders/Platforms)

### Skip Unnecessary Introductory Convincing
*   **Avoid:** Long introductory paragraphs convincing readers why mobile apps are worthwhile when the article topic is about finding app solutions.
*   **Context:** If readers are searching for "best BigCommerce app builders" or "top Shopify app agencies," they're already convinced they need an app.
*   **Action:** Cut straight to the topic. Start with the value proposition or directly introduce the comparison.
*   **Rationale:** Readers clicking on comparison articles have already passed the "should I get an app?" question. They're searching for solutions, not justification.

### Use Clear Parent H2 Headers for Main Topics
*   **Format:** For articles about "X best builders for [platform]" or "top agencies," create a clear H2 header that states the main topic.
*   **Example:** Instead of jumping directly to individual listings, use "The Top 10 BigCommerce Mobile App Development Agencies" as an H2, then list each agency as H3s underneath.
*   **Rationale:** Improves content hierarchy, scannability, and SEO structure by clearly organizing the main content section.

### Position MobiLoud as a Leading Solution
*   **Avoid:** Positioning MobiLoud as an "alternative" to agencies or other solutions (e.g., "MobiLoud is the best *alternative* to a traditional mobile app development agency").
*   **Say:** "MobiLoud is the best mobile app development solution for [platform] merchants."
*   **Rationale:** Calling ourselves an "alternative" may lead readers to pass us over as if we're not a real agency or legitimate solution. We're as capable as any of these companies for what merchants want to accomplish.

### Remove "Best For" and "Consideration" Sections for Competitors
*   **Avoid:** Adding "Best for" or "Consideration" sections when describing competitor agencies or platforms.
*   **Rationale:** These sections make assumptions we cannot verify about how these companies work, the size of projects they handle, time required, costs, etc. We don't have insider knowledge of their operations.
*   **Action:** Describe what the company does and their stated strengths, but avoid making recommendations or assumptions about who they're best suited for.

### Avoid Subjective and Negative Language
*   **Avoid:** Using subjective or negative descriptors like "generic," "limited," "severe limits," or other judgmental terms when describing competitor products.
*   **Example:** Don't say "block-based builders can feel generic" or "you're often limited to their design blocks."
*   **Context:** We don't know if these companies offer custom development, custom design elements, or workarounds that mitigate the limitations we're assuming exist.
*   **Say:** Keep language neutral and factual. Focus on describing what the product *is* rather than making value judgments about what it *lacks*.
*   **Rationale:** Maintains professionalism, avoids potential factual errors, and prevents coming across as overly competitive or dismissive.

### Avoid Unverified Assumptions
*   **Avoid:** Making specific claims about competitors' technical capabilities, timelines, costs, or limitations that we haven't verified.
*   **Examples to Avoid:**
    *   "Information on their specific tech stack is less transparent"
    *   "If it's a custom build, the usual warnings about cost and maintenance apply"
    *   Specific timeline estimates for competitor projects
    *   Assumptions about what features they offer or don't offer
*   **Action:** Stick to publicly available information and general industry patterns. If uncertain, don't make the claim.
*   **Rationale:** Prevents factual errors and maintains credibility. It's better to be vague than wrong.

### Eliminate Vague and Fluffy Language
*   **Avoid:** Abstract or unclear phrases that don't communicate concrete value.
*   **Example:** "Your website is your engine" sounds vague and unclear.
*   **Say:** "Your website works well" or more specific value statements like "Your website already has the features, design, and integrations you need."
*   **Rationale:** Clear, concrete language is more persuasive and easier to understand than metaphorical or abstract phrasing.

### Detailed Platform Introductions
*   **Guideline:** For listicles of platforms, include a longer introduction for each item.
*   **Content:** Detail what the platform is doing and specifically *why* it is good for the title, topic, or use case being discussed in the article.
*   **Rationale:** Provides valuable context to the reader, tying the platform specifically to their search intent rather than just listing features.

### Preferred & Avoided Platforms (Partnerships)
*   **Avoid:** Vajro, Superfans.
*   **Prefer:** StoreLab, Appbrew.
*   **Context:** We have good relationships and partnerships with StoreLab and Appbrew. Prioritize featuring them in listicles where appropriate.
