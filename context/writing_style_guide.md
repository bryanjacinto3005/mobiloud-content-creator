# Tone of Voice and Writing Style Guide

## 1. Target Voice Definition

### Voice archetype
**Strategic operator + experienced partner.**

### Primary goal
Help a busy decision-maker understand:
- **what’s happening**,
- **why it happens** (mechanism),
- **what it means** (payoff/tradeoff),
- **what to do next** (action).

### Tone constraints
- **Confident and directive** (minimal hedging)
- **Practical and outcome-led** (impact, effort, risk, tradeoffs)
- **Reader-forward** (writes to “you” and real constraints)
- **Low-fluff** (no hype, no grandstanding, no long theory)

## 2. Non-Negotiable Construction Rules

### 2.1 Paragraph rules

**MUST**
- Default to 1–2 sentences per paragraph.
- Use one-sentence paragraphs for pivots, emphasis, or turning points.
- Give every paragraph a single job (do not mix multiple jobs).

**SHOULD**
- Insert white space frequently. Readability and scanability are part of the voice.

**Paragraph “jobs” (choose one per paragraph):**
- Context
- Problem
- Mechanism (why it happens)
- Implication (so what)
- Action (what to do)
- Tradeoff/criteria
- Takeaway (wrap)

### 2.2 Sentence rules

**MUST**
- Use declarative, plain-English sentences.
- Prefer strong verbs and concrete nouns.
- Avoid stacked clauses and academic phrasing.

**SHOULD**
- Maintain cadence by alternating:
    - one longer explanatory sentence
    - one short punch sentence

**MAY**
- Use a short aside for a constraint or clarifier (keep it brief, functional).

## 3. Universal Logic Flow

Every section (and most subsections) should follow this chain:

### REQUIRED section flow
1.  **Problem:** what’s not working, misunderstood, risky, slow, expensive, or limiting
2.  **Mechanism:** why it happens (behavior, system constraint, process friction)
3.  **Payoff/Tradeoff:** what changes if solved + what it costs/risks
4.  **Action:** steps, checklist, decision criteria, or measurement guidance

### REQUIRED pivot line
Use a single “hinge” sentence to transition from problem to solution. This voice relies on crisp pivots.

**Examples (use sparingly, don’t overdo):**
- “But here’s the problem.”
- “That’s the tradeoff.”
- “That’s where ___ helps.”
- “That’s why this matters.”
- “The key is ___.”

## 4. Structure and Formatting Standards

### 4.1 Headings

**MUST**
- Write headings as labels (clear, literal, skimmable).
- Avoid clever or abstract headings.
- **Avoid question framing:** Use absolute, direct statements instead of questions (e.g., "X Is the Best Option" instead of "Why Is X the Best?").

**Preferred heading types**
- What X is
- Why X matters
- What changes in practice
- Common mistakes
- How to do X
- How to choose between A and B
- Metrics to watch
- Bottom line

### 4.2 Lists

**MUST**
- Convert complexity into lists.
- If you’re about to describe 3+ items, use bullets or numbered steps.

**Rules**
- **Bullets** for attributes, pros/cons, checklists, criteria
- **Numbered lists** for sequences or processes

### 4.3 Emphasis (bold)

**SHOULD**
- Bold only what a skimmer needs:
    - key metric
    - constraint
    - takeaway phrase
    - decision criteria

**MUST NOT**
- Bold full sentences repeatedly.
- Use bold as decoration.

## 5. Language and Vocabulary Controls

### 5.1 Verbs (preferred)
Use verbs that signal execution and outcomes:
- build, launch, implement, ship, test, measure
- reduce, increase, improve, optimize
- compare, prioritize, choose, validate
- drive, convert, retain, re-engage, compound

### 5.2 Mechanism nouns (use consistently)
These create a “why it works” feel across any topic:
- friction, overhead, complexity
- constraint, tradeoff
- confidence, trust
- loop, habit, drop-off
- maintenance, workload

### 5.3 Intensifiers (hype control)

**MUST**
- Avoid guarantees and exaggerated claims.

**SHOULD**
- Use measured language: meaningul, material, significant, reliable, sustainable

**MAY**
- Use stronger intensifiers only when followed by proof or a constraint: major, outsized, critical (If used, immediately explain why it’s true.)

## 6. Recommendations and Comparisons

### 6.1 Recommendation style

**MUST**
- Be directive, but grounded in constraints.

**Recommended form**
- “If you prioritize ___, do ___.”
- “If your constraint is ___, start with ___.”
- “This is usually the right default when ___.”

### 6.2 Comparison style

**MUST**
- Compare options on tradeoffs, not identity.
- Avoid vendor bashing.

**Use consistent criteria**
- time to implement
- cost (including hidden costs)
- maintenance burden
- flexibility/customization
- risk and failure modes
- skill/ownership requirements

## 7. Actionable Guidance Requirement

Each major section must conclude with practical, immediately applicable guidance. Do NOT use template headings like "How to apply this" or labeled sections like "Do:", "Avoid:", "Measure:".

**MUST include (woven naturally into prose)**
- A clear directive or recommended action (what to do)
- What to avoid or common pitfalls
- How to measure success or validate the approach
- Context-sensitive guidance for constrained scenarios (bandwidth, budget, resources, timeline, etc.)

**Structure approach**
- Write this as flowing, practical prose or concise bullet points
- Lead with the action or decision criteria
- Follow with the tradeoff or constraint guidance
- Close with measurement or validation steps

**Example of natural integration:**
> Pick a builder based on who will manage the app long-term. If your team maintains content weekly, choose a platform with strong CMS integration. If bandwidth is limited, prioritize managed services.
>
> Avoid underestimating the ongoing content and campaign work required.
>
> Track time to launch and weekly app maintenance hours to validate your choice.

This keeps every section practical and actionable without forced formatting.

## 8. “Sound Rules” (What It Should Feel Like)

**MUST**
- Feel like guidance from someone who has seen the patterns before.
- Prioritize clarity and momentum.
- Make the reader feel led through the argument.

**MUST NOT**
- Sound like a lecture, a manifesto, or a sales page.
- Drift into abstract theory without an action path.

## 9. Anti-Patterns to Reject

**Avoid**
- Long paragraphs (3+ sentences repeatedly)
- Vague claims without mechanism (“X is important” with no why)
- Over-qualifying (“maybe”, “might”, “could” stacked together)
- Generic marketing phrasing (“game-changing”, “next-level”, “revolutionary”)
- Feature dumping without payoff or prioritization
- Conclusions that don’t give a next step

## 10. Structural Patterns (for calibration only)

These demonstrate how the rules combine into natural prose. Do NOT copy the structure literally. Extract the **approach**, not the labels.

**Pattern A: Problem → Pivot → Mechanism → Payoff**

State the problem plainly. Use a crisp transition to shift focus. Explain the underlying mechanism (the "why"). Close with the concrete impact or tradeoff.

> Web sessions are temporary. But here's the problem. You have to win attention again every time. That increases acquisition pressure and slows repeat revenue.

**Pattern B: Actionable guidance integration**

Provide directive advice, followed by what to avoid, then measurement criteria, and constraint-based refinement. Write this as **flowing prose**, not a labeled template.

> Reduce steps in the critical flow to improve completion rates. Avoid adding options that increase hesitation. Track completion rate and time-to-complete. If constrained by dev time, fix the single highest-drop-off step first.

**Key principle:** The structure should be **invisible** to the reader. They should feel guided and informed, not like they're reading a form or checklist.
