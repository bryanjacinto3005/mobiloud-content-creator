# Messaging & Positioning Principles

## Preserve What Already Works

- Do not suggest that customers need a new website to get an app.
- Assume the existing site has years of optimization work behind it.
- Position the app as a way to carry all that optimization over to a native experience.

Preferred language:

- “We use your existing site as the foundation.”
- “You keep every tweak that already drives conversions.”

Avoid:

- “Rebuild,” “start from scratch,” “reinvent your store,” except when explaining why that approach is wasteful.

## Lead With Retention and Lifetime Value

- Do not frame apps purely as “better conversion funnels” than mobile web.
- The app is primarily a retention engine and repeat purchase driver.

Emphasize:

- Higher repeat purchase rates.
- Higher customer lifetime value.
- More frequent visits from top customers.
- The app as an owned channel on the home screen.
- Push notifications as a permanent retention lever.

Avoid:

- Treating the app only as a conversion hack.
- Suggesting mobile web cannot convert well; the app amplifies what already works.

## Performance and User Experience Claims

- The app displays the website; if the site is slow, the app will also be slow.
- Do not claim the app magically fixes a slow or broken site.

Focus on real UX benefits:

- One-tap access from the home screen.
- Dedicated environment with fewer distractions.
- No browser UI clutter or multiple tabs.
- Longer sessions and more products viewed.
- Easier retention via push.

Avoid:

- “Mobile web has performance ceilings.”
- “Mobile sites lag or constantly reload.”
- Promising pre-loaded experiences, saved payment details, or pre-filled addresses as unique app benefits when those are provided by the underlying site or browser.

## CAC, LTV, and Financial Framing

- Do not claim that apps lower customer acquisition costs.
- CAC is driven by acquisition channels and funnel efficiency, not app vs web alone.

Correct framing:

- Apps increase lifetime value at the same CAC.
- Apps reduce the impact of rising CAC by extracting more revenue from each acquired customer.

## Pricing and Plan Positioning

Internal structure:

- One-time setup fee.
- Monthly subscription.
- Tiers such as Startup, Growth, and Corporate.

External framing:

- “Setup fee + monthly subscription.”
- Directional price statements where needed:
  - “Starts from a few hundred per month.”
  - “Low four figures upfront.”
- Emphasize:
  - No revenue share.
  - Competitive economics compared to agencies and app builders that layer subscription plus performance fees.

Avoid:

- Exact price quotes unless confirmed current and approved.
- Anchoring around the lowest-tier plan.

Competitor pricing reality (for mid-market brands using leading Shopify app builders):

- Typical total range around **$600–1,500 per month** once all subscriptions and performance fees are included.
- Always verify numbers against current public pricing before publishing.

## Timelines and Expectations

- Under-promise and over-deliver.

Preferred phrasing:

- “Launch in around 30 days.”
- “Typically live in about 4 weeks.”

Avoid:

- “Launch in 2 weeks” or other aggressive promises that are hard to guarantee.

## Competitor Positioning

General content:

- Default to generic categories:
  - “DIY app builders”
  - “Template-based Shopify tools”
  - “Agencies”
  - “Generic SaaS tools”
- Focus on:
  - What each category is good for.
  - The structural trade-offs of each model.

When naming specific competitors:

- Only in explicit comparison pieces or clear case studies.
- Be fair, factual, and verifiable.
- A competitor should recognize themselves in your description.

Avoid:

- Subjective slam adjectives:
  - “Limited,” “expensive,” “outdated,” “clunky,” “buggy,” “basic,” “cookie-cutter.”
- Unverifiable claims about contracts, support quality, or internal practices.
- Predicting future failure:
  - “You will eventually outgrow it.”
  - “It is only a matter of time.”

## Secondary Angles and Objections

- Do not lead with niche or low-priority comparisons, such as detailed analysis of the Shop app.
- Lead with major objections:
  - “I do not need an app.”
  - “My website is enough.”
  - “I am worried about adoption or ROI.”
- Use secondary angles later in the piece, after the primary questions are addressed.

## Email, SMS, and Push Positioning

- Push notifications are complementary to email and SMS, not replacements.

Clarify:

- Email and SMS remain important but are under pressure due to:
  - Spam and promotions filters.
  - SMS filtering and compliance.
  - Rising costs as lists grow.
- Push fills gaps between these channels:
  - Immediate reach.
  - Higher visibility for app users.

Correct push phrasing:

- “Push notifications are seen by almost everyone who has the app installed.”

Avoid:

- “Everyone sees push notifications.”
- Framing email and SMS as ineffective or obsolete.

## Third-Party Tools and Sentiment

- Be realistic and neutral about tools like Klaviyo and other retention platforms.

Preferred framing:

- “[Tool] is powerful and often essential, but as your list grows, so does your monthly bill.”

Avoid:

- “You probably love [Tool].”
- Assuming emotional attachment to specific vendors.
