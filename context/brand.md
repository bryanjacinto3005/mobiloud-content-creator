# Brand & Product Fundamentals

## What the Product Is

- Fully managed website-to-app service.
- Converts an existing, mobile-optimized website into full-featured iOS and Android apps.
- Not a DIY builder and not a custom development agency.
- A long-term, done-for-you partner focused on retention and revenue.

### Customer-Facing Language

- Say: “We use your existing site as the foundation for a full-featured mobile app.”
- Emphasize: “Full-featured mobile app,” “native app experience,” “real app on the home screen.”
- Avoid in customer-facing content:
  - “Wrapper,” “container,” “hybrid” when speaking to merchants.
  - Deep technical implementation details, unless the piece is explicitly technical.

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

MobiLoud is built for:

- Established ecommerce brands and web-first businesses with:
  - A working, mobile-optimized site.
  - Existing traffic and revenue.
- Platforms such as:
  - Shopify
  - BigCommerce
  - WooCommerce
  - Adobe Commerce / Magento
  - Custom or headless builds.
- Teams that:
  - Care about retention, lifetime value, and repeat purchases.
  - Want a professional app without an internal app team.
  - Prefer a partner model over another tool to manage.

Less ideal:

- Early-stage projects with unproven websites.
- Businesses needing heavily custom, device-specific native features (for example AR or advanced offline).
- Teams that want an app experience completely unrelated to their site.

## Market Position

- Positioned as a premium, fully managed “third way” between:
  - Expensive, slow custom agencies.
  - Cheap DIY builders with templates and limited integrations.
- Reputation:
  - Trustworthy, expert, high-touch partner.
  - Hundreds of stores and thousands of apps published.
  - Strong reviews on major software review platforms.
- Key differentiator vs Shopify-only builders:
  - Platform-agnostic: works with any website, not only Shopify.
  - Service-led: the team does the work; merchants stay focused on their business.

## Product and Architecture

Internal understanding (for internal or technical content):

- Native iOS and Android apps that load the existing website inside a webview.
- Native navigation and UI components on top of the site.
- Push notifications and app-only features where relevant.

Customer-facing framing:

- The app mirrors everything that already works on the mobile site.
- The app adds:
  - One-tap access from the home screen.
  - A focused environment with fewer distractions than a browser.
  - Unlimited push notifications.
- Emphasize:
  - Full feature parity with the mobile site.
  - Automatic syncing: change it once on the site, it appears in the app.

## The Nine Universal Selling Points

Use these nine differentiators as the backbone of major positioning and comparison content:

1. **No Rebuild Required**  
   The existing site is converted into an app. There is no separate rebuild inside a new platform.

2. **Everything Works, Instantly**  
   All existing plugins, Shopify apps, extensions, and custom code continue to work in the app.

3. **Fully Managed, Done-For-You Service**  
   The team builds, maintains, updates, and supports the app as an ongoing service.

4. **Unlimited Push Notifications**  
   No caps or per-subscriber fees for push notifications.

5. **No Revenue Share or Hidden Fees**  
   Flat, predictable subscription and setup fee. No percentage of app revenue.

6. **Always in Sync**  
   Any change on the website is automatically reflected in the app.

7. **Guaranteed App Store Approval**  
   The team handles submissions and works with Apple and Google until approval.

8. **ROI-Driven Results**  
   App users generate significantly higher lifetime value than mobile web visitors, and apps often drive a notable share of total sales.

9. **No Extra Tech Debt**  
   Only one codebase to manage: the website. There is no separate app codebase to maintain.
