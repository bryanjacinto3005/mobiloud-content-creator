# Master Writing Guidelines

## 1. Objective

Create factual, objective content that explains MobiLoud as a fully managed website-to-app service for established ecommerce brands.

## 2. Non-negotiable: factual + objective

**Every meaningful claim must be verifiable** (public docs, pricing pages, product documentation, credible reports, published case studies, attributed quotes).

- If a statement cannot be backed, remove it or rewrite it as a scoped, attributed claim.
- **Do not include assumption-driven sections** like “Best For” or “Not For” for any product.

## 3. Messaging and positioning principles

### 3.1 Preserve what already works

- Do not suggest customers need a new website to get an app.
- Assume the existing site has years of optimization behind it.
- Position the app as a way to carry that optimization into a native iOS and Android experience.

**Approved phrasing:**
- “We use your existing site as the foundation.”
- “You keep every tweak that already drives conversions.”

### 3.2 Lead with retention and lifetime value

- Do not frame apps purely as better conversion funnels than mobile web.
- Frame the app as a retention and repeat purchase driver.

### 3.3 Position MobiLoud as a primary solution

- Do not present MobiLoud as an “alternative” to agencies or builders.
- Use direct language that treats MobiLoud as a legitimate app development solution.

### 3.4 Terminology constraints for describing the tech

- **Strict Ban:** Do not use the words "wrapper," "container," "shell," or "hybrid" — **not even to explain what MobiLoud is "not".**
- **Guideline:** Never attempt to clarify that MobiLoud "is not a wrapper." Mentioning the word invites the comparison. Ignore the concept entirely.
- **Approved Phrasing:** Stick religiously to the **MobiLoud Brand Bible** definitions: "Website-to-app platform," "Fully managed service," "Premium third way."

### 3.5 Audience focus constraints (Strict)

- **Target Audience:** Established brands generating revenue.
- **Strict Ban:** Do not address or acknowledge "startups," "hobbyists," "zero-budget projects," or "developers" in comparison logic.
- **Why:** Mentioning them suggests the tool might be for them, diluting our premium positioning.
- **Rule:** Assume the reader is already qualified. Do not offer "if you are just starting out" caveats.

### 3.6 Specificity and Clarity

- **Precision is key:** Do not use vague terms when a specific one exists.
- **Strict Ban:** **Never** use "mobile" as a standalone noun when you mean "mobile app" or "mobile website".
- **Why:** "Mobile" is ambiguous (device? channel? industry?).
- **Correct Usage:**
  - "The **mobile app** drives retention." (Not "Mobile drives retention")
  - "optimize for **mobile devices**."
  - "traffic from **mobile web**."

## 4. Platform association rules

- Avoid positioning MobiLoud as primarily a WordPress tool or WordPress app builder.
- When platforms are mentioned, keep it general or list multiple platforms together (example: Shopify, WooCommerce, custom builds).

## 5. Claims and technical accuracy (hard constraints)

### 5.1 Performance

- The app displays the website. **If the site is slow, the app can be slow.**
- **Do not claim the app fixes a slow or broken site.**

### 5.2 Checkout

- **Do not claim the app removes checkout friction by default.**
- Checkout mirrors the mobile website; if friction exists on site, it exists in the app.

### 5.3 Push notifications

- **Do not imply universal reach.**
- Correct phrasing must scope to people who have the app installed (and opted in, if relevant).

### 5.4 CAC and LTV framing

- **Do not claim apps lower CAC.**
- Correct framing: apps increase LTV without increasing CAC, reducing the impact of rising CAC.

### 5.5 Conversion metric hierarchy

- **Do not treat conversion rate as the most important financial argument by default.**
- Prefer revenue per user when discussing business impact (only with support).

## 6. Pricing and plan positioning

### 6.1 MobiLoud pricing language (rules)

- **Always:** setup fee + monthly subscription.
- Avoid specific numbers for MobiLoud pricing; use directional ranges only.
- Default value framing around the Growth plan, not the cheapest tier.
- If stating “no revenue share,” do not imply competitors are hiding information. State it plainly when accurate.

### 6.2 Competitor pricing

- You may include explicit competitor plan pricing, but verify it against current public pricing before publishing.
- When describing the category, prefer category language over naming many brands.

## 7. Timelines

- **Under-promise.**
- Use “around 30 days” or “about 4 weeks.”
- Avoid aggressive promises like “2 weeks” unless verified and reliably deliverable.

## 8. Competitor positioning and comparisons

### 8.1 Default to categories

Use category labels unless the piece requires naming:
- DIY app builders
- Template-based Shopify tools
- Agencies
- Generic SaaS tools

### 8.2 Tone constraints (hard rules)

- **No slam adjectives** (limited, clunky, cookie-cutter, buggy, outdated, expensive).
- No claims about contracts, support quality, internal practices, or future failure unless sourced.

### 8.3 Competitor sections must include real context

- Do not describe tools in one or two sentences.
- Include a few sentences: what it is, what it does, what makes it different (only factual).

### 8.4 Prohibited sections

- **No “Best For” / “Not For” / “Consideration” sections.**

**Allowed replacement sections:**
- Key Features
- Requirements / Constraints
- Pricing
- Implementation Notes
- Documented Limitations (only when sourced)

## 9. Content prioritization

- Lead with major objections: “I don’t need an app,” “My website is enough,” “I’m worried about adoption or ROI.”
- Do not lead with niche angles like deep Shop app comparisons.

## 10. Email, SMS, and push positioning

- Push complements email and SMS, not a replacement.
- Do not frame email and SMS as obsolete or ineffective.
- If you mention channel pressure (filters, compliance, rising costs), keep it factual and scoped.

## 11. Third-party tools and sentiment

- Stay neutral about tools like Klaviyo.
- Do not assume emotional attachment.
- **Approved framing:** powerful and often necessary, but costs can rise as lists grow.

## 12. Social proof rules

- Verify the brand is still a live MobiLoud customer before citing them.
- It is fine to use one deep case study, then link to a broader portfolio.

## 13. Drafting workflow and formatting rules

**Before you write:**
- Clarify audience, decision being made, and funnel stage.

**Drafting flow:**
- Problem -> why it matters -> how it works -> next step.

**Bullets (mandatory rule):**
- If you write a sentence with 3 or more items, convert to bullets immediately.
- Default to bullets for features and comparisons.

**Comparison and review intro flow (when relevant):**
- Acknowledge intent (they want an app)
- Acknowledge cost concerns
- Note there are options
- Set expectations for what the piece will cover

**Key Takeaways block (if included):**
- One paragraph only
- No bullets
- Max 70 words

## 14. Human writing requirements and AI-quirk avoidance

### 14.1 Must sound human
- Write naturally and directly, like a human expert would.
- Avoid cliché openers, “not just X but Y” patterns, heavy hedging, buzzwords, and unusual punctuation habits.

### 14.2 Do not reuse examples verbatim
- If you borrow an example or phrasing from internal guidelines, **rewrite it in fresh language** so articles do not sound repetitive.

### 14.3 Punctuation ban
- **No em dash character anywhere in the draft.**
- Use a period, comma, colon, or parentheses instead.

## 15. Partnership preferences (only when you must list options)

- **Prefer:** StoreLab, Appbrew
- **Avoid highlighting:** Vajro, Superfans (unless required by the brief)
