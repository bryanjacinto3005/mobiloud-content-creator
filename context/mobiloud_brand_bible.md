# MobiLoud Brand Bible

## 1. Product Overview

MobiLoud turns your existing ecommerce website into native iOS and Android apps in around 30 days, without rebuilding your store or adding ongoing engineering work.

## 2. What MobiLoud Is

- **A fully managed website-to-app service**
- **Uses your existing site as the foundation for a full-featured mobile app**
- **Delivers a real app on the home screen with a native app experience**
- **A long-term, done-for-you partner focused on retention and revenue**

## 3. What MobiLoud Is Not

- **Not a DIY app builder**
- **Not a custom development agency project**
- **Not a separate product your team has to maintain alongside the website**

## 4. Ideal Customer Profile

### Best fit

**Established ecommerce brands with:**
- A working, mobile-optimized website
- Existing traffic and revenue

**Common platforms:**
- Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Adobe Commerce (Magento), custom/headless builds

**Teams that:**
- Care about retention, lifetime value, and repeat purchases
- Want an app without hiring an internal app team
- Prefer a partner model over another tool to manage

### Less ideal

- Early-stage projects with unproven websites
- Brands needing heavily custom device-specific native features (e.g., AR, advanced offline)

## 5. Market Positioning

MobiLoud is a premium “third way” between:
- **Custom agencies** (expensive, slow, ongoing maintenance)
- **DIY builders** (templates, limitations, and extra management burden)

**Key differentiators:**
- **Platform-agnostic:** Works beyond Shopify-only approaches.
- **Service-led:** MobiLoud does the work; merchants focus on their business.

## 6. Core Value Proposition

> You keep managing your website. Your customers get a premium mobile app experience.

## 7. Core Benefits (Universal Selling Points)

- **No Rebuild Required**
  Your existing site becomes the foundation of the app.
- **Everything That Works on Your Site Keeps Working**
  Your existing plugins, extensions, and custom logic carry over.
- **Fully Managed, Done-For-You**
  Setup, publishing support, updates, maintenance, and support are handled for you.
- **Unlimited Push Notifications**
  No per-subscriber fees or caps.
- **No Revenue Share**

- **Always in Sync**
  Website changes automatically carry over to the app.
- **No Extra Tech Debt**
  One primary system to maintain: your website.

## 8. Retention and Revenue Growth

Apps help brands get more value from their best customers through:
- One-tap access from the home screen
- A focused experience with fewer distractions than a browser
- Push notifications to drive repeat purchases and recover abandoned carts

### Push notifications

**Compatibility promise:** If it works on your mobile website, it will work in the app as well.
