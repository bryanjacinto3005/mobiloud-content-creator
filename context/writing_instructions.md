# Operational Rules for Writers and AI Agents

## Before You Write

- Clarify the audience:
  - Shopify merchants, multi-platform brands, publishers, or another defined segment.
- Clarify the decision or question the reader is facing.
- Clarify where the piece sits in the funnel:
  - Awareness, consideration, or decision stage.
- Re-scan:
  - The brand and messaging principles.
  - The voice and style guide.
  - Any relevant comparison or playbook guidance.

## Drafting Process

- Write naturally and directly, as a human expert would.
- Follow a clear flow:
  - Problem → why it matters → how the solution works → next step.
- While drafting:
  - Weave in the nine core selling points where appropriate.
  - Address main objections early.
  - Use subheads that communicate real takeaways.
  - **Use bullet points as you draft** - Don't wait until formatting. When you write a sentence with 3+ items, immediately convert to bullets.
  - **Default to bullets for features and comparisons** - Any time you're listing capabilities, benefits, or comparison points, use bullets from the start.

## Self-Check Against Constraints

Before submitting or publishing a draft, check for:

- Banned or weak patterns:
  - Cliché openers.
  - “Not just X, but Y” constructions.
  - Hedging phrases such as “it depends” or “it is important to note that” in core claims.
  - Connected em-dashes or unusual punctuation choices.
  - Buzzwords and generic corporate language.
- Messaging contradictions:
  - Retention vs conversion framing.
  - CAC and LTV explanations.
  - Performance and UX claims.
  - Pricing and timeline statements.
- Unverified facts:
  - Remove or flag any claim you are not certain about.

## Formatting and Delivery

- Use clear, consistent headings:
  - Title Case where appropriate.
- Keep paragraphs short and spaced for readability.
- **Use bullet points for (MANDATORY):**
  - Multi-step processes.
  - Sets of reasons or features (3+ items).
  - Breaking up dense paragraphs for better readability.
  - **Any "Choose X if..." or decision guide sections.**
  - **Platform capabilities, tool features, or product attributes.**
  - **Comparison points between options.**
  - **Pricing/plan details and technical specifications.**
- **Bullet Point Rule**: If you find yourself writing "X, Y, and Z" or "X. Y. Z." with 3+ items, use bullets instead.
- Include metadata for blog and comparison posts:
  - Article title.
  - Slug.
  - SEO title.
  - Meta description.
- Add the dual call to action where required:
  - Especially in comparison and bottom-of-funnel content.

## Final Quality Check

Before a piece goes live, ask:

1. Would a sharp founder read this and nod instead of rolling their eyes?
2. Does every paragraph teach something or move the argument forward?
3. Does the piece sound like something an experienced team member would actually say?
4. Is there at least one line worth quoting or remembering later?
5. Would you be comfortable having this represent the brand on the homepage?
6. **Are features, comparisons, and lists formatted as bullets instead of dense prose?**

If the answer to any of these is "no," revise until it is "yes."
