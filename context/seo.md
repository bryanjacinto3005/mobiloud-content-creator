# SEO and Accuracy

## On-Page SEO Fundamentals

- Focus each piece on one primary keyword.
- Include related entities and topics where natural:
  - For example: Shopify, iOS, push notifications, mobile app, retention.
- Front-load clarity:
  - State what the article is about in the first 100 words.
- Use clear references:
  - "MobiLoud converts websites into mobile apps," not "It does this."

## AI and Snippet Visibility

- Make each section self-contained:
  - A reader or AI snippet should be able to extract a section and still understand it.
- Use clear structure:
  - Headings, bullets, and short paragraphs.
- Avoid vague pronouns:
  - Refer explicitly to "MobiLoud," "the app," or "the website" instead of "it" when clarity matters.
 - When you describe generic categories that we want to rank for (for example, "website-to-app services" or "website-to-app tools"), it is usually better to write "a website-to-app service like MobiLoud" so our brand is consistently associated with those terms.

## Accuracy and Evidence

- If you are not sure a claim is true, leave it out or flag it for review.
- Do not invent:
  - Performance numbers.
  - Customer counts.
  - Revenue or adoption statistics.
- It is acceptable to:
  - Use ranges that reflect real patterns.
  - Refer to benchmark data that has been validated.

## Push Notification Claims

- Use accurate framing:
  - "Push notifications are seen by almost everyone who has the app installed."
- Do not say:
  - "Everyone sees push notifications."
- Clarify:
  - Users control their own notification settings and permissions.

## Performance and UX Claims

- Avoid claiming:
  - The app has inherently lower latency than the site.
  - The app automatically fixes all speed issues.
- Focus instead on:
  - The app feeling more focused and easier to return to.
  - Removal of browser clutter and tabs.
  - Typically longer sessions and more products viewed among app users, where benchmarks support this.

## AOV and Revenue Claims

- When explaining higher average order value from app users, anchor on:
  - Fewer distractions during browsing.
  - Longer engagement and more products seen per session.
  - The fact that app users are often a brand's best customers, who chose to install the app.
- Avoid:
  - "Mobile sites are too clunky" as the core explanation.
  - Claiming that checkout flows are inherently smoother if they are identical to the site.

## Social Proof and Third-Party References

- Only reference active customers as examples.
- Before publishing:
  - Check that the brand still uses the product.
  - Confirm that case studies reflect current reality.
- If in doubt about a logo or quote, omit it or mark it for review.
- It is acceptable to reference:
  - Public review platforms if you reflect real scores or consistent sentiment.
  - Industry benchmark data with clear sourcing.
