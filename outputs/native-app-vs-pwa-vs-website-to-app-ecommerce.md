## Key Takeaways

For established ecommerce brands, the "Website-to-App" approach (used by MobiLoud) offers the highest Return on Investment (ROI) by combining the speed and efficiency of the web with the retention power of a native app. While custom native apps are powerful, they require exorbitant budgets and maintenance. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are cost-effective but suffer from low adoption and limited iOS support. Website-to-app solutions allow you to leverage your existing site to launch a premium native app in weeks, not months, ensuring you capture the mobile market without incurring massive technical debt.

## Introduction

Mobile commerce is no longer just a trend; it is the dominant force in digital retail. With over [76% of US smartphone users shopping via apps](https://www.mobiloud.com/reports/ecommerce-benchmark-report), brands that fail to offer a dedicated mobile experience risk leaving significant revenue on the table. However, the path to launching an app is not always clear.

Ecommerce directors and founders are typically faced with three distinct options: building a custom native app from scratch, settling for a Progressive Web App (PWA), or using a website-to-app platform. Each route comes with its own set of costs, timelines, and technical tradeoffs.

The wrong choice can lead to wasted months and hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost opportunity. The right choice, however, can unlock a new channel that drives retention and increases Customer Lifetime Value (LTV). In this guide, we will compare these three approaches head-to-head to help you decide which mobile strategy delivers the best ROI for your business.

## The 3 Main Approaches to Mobile Apps

Before diving into the ROI analysis, it is essential to define what we mean by each of these three options.

*   **Custom Native App:** An app built from scratch using platform-specific languages (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android) or cross-platform frameworks (React Native, Flutter). This is the traditional "agency" route.
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** A website optimized to look and feel like an app. Users can "install" it to their home screen directly from the browser, bypassing the [App Store](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/publishing-pwa-app-store).
*   **Website-to-App (MobiLoud):** A specialized service that turns your existing mobile website into a fully functional native app. This allows you to publish a real app to the App Store and Google Play while maintaining a single codebase.

## 1. Custom Native App Development

Building a custom native app is often seen as the "gold standard" by developers, but for ecommerce brands, it can quickly become a money pit.

### The Upside of Custom Native
*   **Ultimate Performance:** Native code runs directly on the device, offering the smoothest possible animations and transitions.
*   **Deep Device Integration:** Ideal if you need complex features like Augmented Reality (AR) try-ons or heavy reliance on specific hardware sensors.
*   **Complete Design Freedom:** You are not constrained by your website’s layout; you can build a completely unique interface.

### The Downside of Custom Native
*   **Exorbitant Costs:** A quality custom ecommerce app typically costs between **$100,000 and $250,000** just for the initial build.
*   **Slow Time-to-Market:** Expect a timeline of **9 to 12 months** before you launch. In the fast-moving world of ecommerce, this is an eternity.
*   **Maintenance Nightmare:** You effectively double your work. Every new feature, payment gateway, or marketing tool added to your website must be manually re-implemented in the iOS app and the Android app.
*   **Feature Parity Lag:** It is incredibly difficult to keep the app in sync with your web store, leading to a fragmented customer experience.

## 2. Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

PWAs were once hailed as the future of mobile, promising to replace native apps entirely. While they have their place, they have largely failed to gain traction with mainstream consumers.

### The Upside of PWAs
*   **Cost-Effective:** Since a PWA is essentially just your website, there is little to no extra development cost if your site is modern.
*   **Single Codebase:** Updates to your website are immediately reflected in the PWA.
*   **Bypass App Store Reviews:** You don't have to deal with Apple or Google’s submission guidelines.

### The Downside of PWAs
*   **Limited iOS Support:** Apple treats PWAs as second-class citizens. Push notifications on iOS are historically unreliable and require complex setup, and users cannot easily discover PWAs.
*   **No App Store Presence:** This is the biggest dealbreaker. Consumers trust the App Store and Google Play. They search for brands there. A PWA requires you to teach users how to "Add to Home Screen" via browser settings—a friction point that kills adoption.
*   **Lower Perceived Value:** Users view "real apps" as premium. A shortcut to a website does not carry the same brand authority.

## 3. Website-to-App (The MobiLoud Model)

The "Website-to-App" approach, pioneered by MobiLoud, is the strategic choice for established brands that want the benefits of a native app without the headache of custom development.

### The Upside of Website-to-App
*   **Speed to Market:** You can launch a fully functional native app in **under 30 days**.
*   **Superior ROI:** With a low setup fee and predictable monthly pricing, you achieve profitability almost immediately.
*   **Real Native Presence:** Unlike PWAs, your app is published in the Apple App Store and Google Play, giving you access to that massive discovery channel.
*   **Zero Maintenance:** The app displays your existing mobile site. When you update a product, banner, or plugin on your site, the app updates instantly.
*   **Full Feature Retention:** All your existing tech stack—reviews, loyalty programs, search, and checkout—works perfectly in the app from day one.

### The Downside of Website-to-App
*   **UI Constraints:** The app interface will mirror your mobile website. However, for ecommerce, this is often a benefit, as it provides a consistent user experience across channels.
*   **Not for Gaming:** If your core product is a mobile game or a complex utility tool, this approach is not suitable.

## Head-to-Head Comparison: Which Drives the Best ROI?

When evaluating these options, the metric that matters most is Return on Investment. Let’s look at how they stack up in key business areas.

### Time to Market and Opportunity Cost
Building a custom app takes roughly a year. That is 12 months of missed revenue from mobile customers. MobiLoud gets you live in weeks. If your app generates $50,000/month, waiting for a custom build costs you **$600,000 in lost revenue** compared to launching immediately.

### The "App Store" Trust Factor
Data shows that app users have **2.8–5x higher Lifetime Value (LTV)** than mobile web users. But to get those users, you need to be where they look: the [App Store](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/app-store-optimization). PWAs fail here completely. A native presence builds trust and puts your brand icon on the most valuable real estate in the world: the customer's home screen.

### Retention and Push Notifications
The primary driver of app revenue is retention. [Push notifications](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/automated-push-notifications) allow you to reach customers directly, bypassing expensive ad networks and crowded email inboxes.
*   **Custom Apps:** Great push support, but expensive to build and manage.
*   **PWAs:** Weak push support, especially on iPhones.
*   **MobiLoud:** Unlimited, native push notifications on both iOS and Android, including [automated abandoned cart recovery](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/do-push-notifications-work-for-abandoned-carts) integration with tools like Klaviyo and OneSignal.

A custom native ecommerce app typically costs between $100,000 and $250,000 for the initial build, plus ongoing maintenance costs that can average 20% of the initial budget annually.

### Can MobiLoud handle my custom checkout?
