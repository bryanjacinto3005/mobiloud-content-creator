## Introduction

As a business owner, you’re probably seeing more and more of your customers browsing and buying on their phones. Maybe your website is getting solid mobile traffic, and it’s starting to feel obvious: you should really have an app.

That instinct is right. A mobile app puts your brand on your customers’ home screens and gives you a direct, always-on channel to reach them. You've decided your business needs a mobile app. Smart move. [Mobile apps drive 88% of all mobile time](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-statistics/) spent by users, offering a direct channel to customers from their home screens.

But that decision is the easy part. The hard part comes next: how do you actually find and hire someone to build it?

If you're a business owner without a technical background, the landscape can feel overwhelming very quickly. Should you hire a freelancer, an agency, or build an in-house team? How much does a mobile app developer cost? How long will it take, and what should you be watching out for?

The mobile app market is booming — [global app revenue hit $535.8 billion in 2024](https://asomobile.net/blogs/app-industry-statistics-2024) — and that growth has created a crowded marketplace of developers promising the world. Some deliver. Many don't.

The good news is you don’t need to be technical to make a good decision here — you just need a clear picture of your options, realistic cost ranges, and what’s actually involved in a typical mobile app project.

In this guide, we'll walk through where to find mobile app developers, what to expect to pay, what goes into building an app, and how to evaluate your options. We'll also share a simpler alternative that might save you from the entire hiring process — if you already have a website.

## Where to Find App Developers

Finding mobile app developers is easier than ever, but finding *good* ones is another story. Here are the most common places business owners look.

### Freelance Platforms

Sites like Upwork, Toptal, and Fiverr give you access to thousands of individual developers.

- **Pros:** Lower cost, flexibility, fast turnaround
- **Cons:** Harder to vet quality, no team support, risk of scope creep

Freelancers work well if you have a clear spec and can manage the project yourself.

### Development Agencies

Agencies offer full-service mobile app development — design, development, testing, and deployment.

- **Pros:** Professional teams, established processes, accountability
- **Cons:** Higher cost (typically $100K+), longer timelines

Agencies work well for big budgets and polished products, but you'll pay premium rates.

### Offshore Development Teams

Hiring offshore — Eastern Europe, South Asia, Latin America — offers lower hourly rates. [Developers in India charge $7–$50/hour](https://www.theintellify.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-hire-an-app-developer), compared to $100–$150/hour+ in the US.

- **Pros:** Significant cost savings, access to large talent pools
- **Cons:** Time zone challenges, communication barriers, variable quality

Offshore can work if you have strong project management and clear requirements. Without that, you risk delays and misalignment.

### In-House Teams

Building an in-house app team means hiring iOS developers, Android developers, and designers.

- **Pros:** Full control, aligned with your business
- **Cons:** Expensive, slow to scale, ongoing salary costs

Most businesses can't justify the overhead unless apps are core to the business model.

## Understanding Mobile App Development Costs

Let's talk numbers. [Mobile app development costs in 2024 ranged from $10,000 to over $500,000](https://www.businessofapps.com/insights/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app/) depending on complexity, platform, and who you hire.

### Simple Apps: $5,000 – $50,000

Think basic functionality — login, simple data display, maybe a form or two. These apps take 2–4 months to build and are fine for MVPs or internal tools.

### Medium Complexity Apps: $50,000 – $150,000

Apps with integrations (payment gateways, third-party APIs), geolocation, push notifications, or social logins fall into this range. Expect 4–7 months of development.

### Complex Apps: $100,000 – $300,000+

Advanced apps with AI, real-time data, custom backends, or heavy customization can easily hit six figures. Development can stretch 9–12+ months.

### What Drives Cost

- **Platform choice:** Building for both iOS and Android costs more than one platform
- **Design complexity:** Custom UI/UX is expensive; templates are cheaper
- **Developer location:** US-based developers cost 3–5x more than offshore teams
- **Features:** Every integration adds time and cost
- **Ongoing maintenance:** Budget 15–20% of build cost annually

## What Goes Into Building a Mobile App

When you hire a mobile app developer, here's what you're actually paying for.

### Discovery and Planning (1–4 weeks)

This is where you define goals, map features, create wireframes, and outline the technical requirements. Skipping this step is how projects go off the rails.

### Design (UI/UX) (3–8 weeks)

Designers create mockups, user flows, and prototypes. Good design makes or breaks user adoption, so don't skimp here.

### Development (6–20 weeks)

Developers write the code for your app — frontend (what users see) and backend (servers, databases, APIs).

If you're building for both iOS and Android natively, you need separate codebases. Cross-platform frameworks like React Native or Flutter can save time but come with trade-offs.

### Testing and QA (3–8 weeks)

Quality assurance teams test the app across devices, operating systems, and edge cases. Bugs caught here are cheaper to fix than bugs caught by users.

### Launch and Deployment (1–2 weeks)

Submitting to the Apple App Store and Google Play involves compliance checks, review processes, and sometimes rejections. Budget time for revisions.

### Post-Launch Maintenance (Ongoing)

Apps need updates — bug fixes, OS compatibility, new features. Most businesses spend $5,000–$20,000+ annually on maintenance.

## Evaluating App Developers

Once you've found a shortlist of candidates, how do you actually vet them?

### Review Their Portfolio

Look for apps similar to what you want to build. Download them. Use them. Are they polished? Do they perform well?

If a developer can't show you live, published apps, that's a red flag.

### Verify Technical Expertise

Ask about their tech stack. Do they specialize in iOS, Android, or cross-platform? What frameworks do they use?

You should understand their approach and why they recommend it.

### Assess Communication

Poor communication kills projects. Ask how they handle updates and feedback. Do they use project management tools? How often will you hear from them?

### Check References

Ask for references from past clients. Were deadlines met? Did the app work as promised?

Testimonials on a website are nice. Conversations with real clients are better.

### Watch for Red Flags

- Promises that sound too good to be true ("We'll build your app in 4 weeks for $10K")
- No contract or vague scope documents
- Upfront payment demands without milestones
- Lack of clarity on ownership and intellectual property rights

## The Reality Check: Time, Effort, and Risk

Even if you find a great developer, building a mobile app isn't a "set it and forget it" process.

[The average app takes 4–6 months to build](https://www.topflightapps.com/ideas/how-long-does-it-take-to-make-an-app), and that's if everything goes smoothly. Delays are common. Scope creep can blow budgets.

You'll need to stay involved — expect weekly calls, design reviews, and testing rounds.

And the work doesn't stop at launch. You'll need to promote the app, gather feedback, fix bugs, and release updates.

For many businesses, the full cost isn't just the development — it's the months of management and iteration.

### What should I look for in a mobile app developer's portfolio?

Look for live, published apps similar to your project. Download them and test the user experience. Check if they're still maintained and updated. A strong portfolio shows technical skill, design quality, and the ability to ship real products to app stores.
