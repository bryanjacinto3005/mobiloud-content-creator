## Introduction

Mobile apps are no longer just "nice to have" for ecommerce brands—they are **one of the most powerful retention channels** available. With mobile commerce projected to account for [nearly 60% of total retail ecommerce sales by 2025](https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/mobile-commerce-sales) and [76% of adults having purchased via mobile](https://www.shopify.com/blog/mobile-commerce), the gap between having a mobile site and a dedicated app is where your most loyal customers live.

Shopney has helped thousands of merchants cross that bridge with easy-to-use design tools.

But "easy to use" can sometimes mean "hard to customize."

Many growing brands start with Shopney and similar builders but eventually feel the limits of a template-based approach. You might want a specific checkout flow, a custom product customizer, or a third-party integration that isn't in a pre-approved block library. When any app builder starts to dictate your strategy rather than enabling it, it's a sign to look for an alternative.

In this guide, we cut through the noise to compare the top Shopney alternatives. We look at options for every stage—from budget-friendly builders for startups to premium, fully managed partners for 7- and 8-figure brands ready to own their mobile audience.

## When Template-Based App Builders (Like Shopney) Hit Their Limits

Template-based app builders like Shopney pitch themselves on design. Their drag-and-drop editors are undeniably polished, and that focus on "design elements" makes for great demos. However, a pretty interface does not always translate into a high-performing revenue channel.

A common reason brands eventually look beyond entry-level builders like Shopney is the **template ceiling** that comes with most block-based builders. Tools in this category typically require you to build your app using their specific widgets. If you use a Shopify app for reviews, loyalty, or sizing that isn't already supported, it may not work in the app or may require workarounds. In practice, you often end up choosing between keeping your preferred tech stack exactly as it is or adapting to the app builder’s supported integrations.

At the same time, many leading Shopify-focused app builders now combine a monthly subscription with **usage or performance-based components**, so a typical mid-market brand can easily end up paying **hundreds or even $600–1,500+ per month** as they scale.

**Key trade-offs of template-based builders often include:**

* **Rigid Design Blocks:** You typically can’t just "mirror" your site; you have to rebuild it using their components.
* **Integration Gaps:** If a tool isn't in their integration library, bringing it into the app can be difficult or require custom work.
* **DIY Management:** You are responsible for designing, updating, and troubleshooting the app.

For many brands, the goal is not just to have an app, but to have a [mobile channel](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/mobile-apps-vs-mobile-websites) that drives real retention. That requires a platform that adapts to your business, not the other way around.

## 1. MobiLoud

**Best for:** Established brands ($1M+ revenue) that want a complete, branded mobile app without compromises or revenue share.

MobiLoud is the "no-compromise" Shopney alternative. Unlike Shopney or Tapcart, we don't force you into a drag-and-drop editor with limited blocks. Instead, we convert your entire existing mobile website into a fully native app experience.

This approach solves the biggest pain point of app builders: **feature parity**.

Because your app is powered by your actual website, everything that works on your site works in the app. Instantly. If you have a complex "Build Your Own Bundle" flow, a custom quiz, or a niche loyalty plugin, it functions smoothly in the app because the app experience is powered by your existing site.

### Why MobiLoud is the Best Alternative

* **No Rebuild Required:** We don't ask you to "rebuild" your store in our dashboard. We use your existing theme, logic, and tech stack.
* **No Extra Tech Debt:** You don’t take on a second platform to design and maintain. Your app uses the stack you already rely on instead of introducing another CMS or visual builder.
* **Fully Managed Service:** You don't need to learn a new CMS. Our team handles the build, submission to Apple and Google, and ongoing updates. You stay focused on your brand and campaigns; we handle the app.
* **Unlimited Push Notifications:** Send as many messages as you want. There are no "usage caps" punishing you for growing your audience. With [cart abandonment rates](https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate) averaging nearly 70%, unlimited abandoned cart pushes are a massive revenue driver.
* **True Real-Time Sync:** Change a banner or price on your site, and it updates in the app instantly. You never have to manage two separate storefronts.
* **No Revenue Share:** Unlike many app builders that layer performance or revenue fees on top of subscriptions, MobiLoud charges a flat setup + subscription. You keep what you earn.

For brands focused on [ROI and retention](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/ecommerce-mobile-app-roi), MobiLoud offers the power of custom development without the six-figure price tag or six-month wait.

**Pros:**

* 100% feature parity with your website.
* Hands-off, white-glove service (we do the work).
* No "integration library" limits—if it’s part of your web experience, it will work in the app.
* No revenue share or performance-based fee structure.

**Cons:**

* Requires a mobile-optimized website to start.
* Not designed for pre-revenue or short-term dropshipping stores.

If you are tired of hearing "our builder doesn't support that feature yet," MobiLoud is your answer.

## 2. Tapcart

**Best for:** Medium-sized brands that want a standardized, "app-like" experience and don't mind template limits.

Tapcart is one of the biggest names in the Shopify app builder space. They have built a reputation on their slick drag-and-drop editor and a large ecosystem of integrations. If Shopney is the "design-focused" builder, Tapcart is the "standard" enterprise builder.

Like Shopney, Tapcart works by providing a library of pre-built blocks (hero image, product grid, countdown timer). You assemble these blocks to build your app layout. It is easy to use and looks professional out of the box.

However, the same limitation applies: **if something isn’t available as a block, adding it to your app can be difficult or require custom work.**

Tapcart is an excellent tool if your store fits comfortably within standard ecommerce functionality. But if you have custom-developed features or use niche Shopify apps, you may find yourself hitting a wall. Their pricing is also significantly higher than Shopney, with their "Enterprise" plans (required for many key features) often costing **well into the four-figure-per-month range** once everything is added up.

For a deeper dive, read our full [Tapcart Alternative](https://www.mobiloud.com/comparisons/tapcart-alternative) comparison.

**Pros:**

* Excellent drag-and-drop editor.
* Large library of standard integrations (Yotpo, Klaviyo, etc.).
* Strong agency partner network.

**Cons:**

* **Expensive:** Core features are often gated behind higher-tier plans, with total monthly costs increasing as you scale.
* **Rigid UX:** Many Tapcart apps tend to look and feel similar.
* **Limited Customization:** Custom blocks and unique flows typically require additional development budget.

## 3. Plobal Apps

**Best for:** Brands that want a mix of customization and template structure, with a focus on guidance and consulting.

Plobal Apps offers a more "guided" experience than Shopney. While they still rely on a template-based system, they offer dedicated success managers on their higher-tier plans to help you build and scale the app.

Plobal is a strong contender for mid-market brands. They have good integrations with major tools and offer features like "uninstall tracking" to help with retention. Their interface is functional, though perhaps less "flashy" than Shopney's design-first editor.

One area where Plobal differs is their focus on "native commerce." They push features that feel very native, but this can sometimes come at the cost of flexibility. If you want to replicate a very specific web experience, Plobal (like the others) will still guide you into their own navigation structure.

**Pros:**

* Dedicated success managers on Enterprise plans.
* Useful AI-driven product recommendation features.
* Solid integration list for standard Shopify apps.

**Cons:**

* Pricing can be complex (often involves premium tiers and potential success-based components).
* Design templates can feel **more conventional** compared to Shopney or Tapcart.
* Still limited by the "block" architecture for advanced customizations.

## 4. Vajro

**Best for:** Budget-conscious stores and brands heavily focused on live selling.

If Shopney is a great starting point, Vajro is the budget-friendly accelerator, particularly for boutiques that rely on live video sales. Vajro was one of the first builders to heavily integrate "live selling" directly into the app, allowing customers to watch a stream and buy instantly.

Vajro is generally more affordable than Tapcart or Plobal. It is a great option for smaller stores or simplified catalogs where the primary goal is just "get an app up" to push notifications and run live sales events.

However, the trade-off is often in the design polish and UX depth. Vajro apps tend to follow more **standardized layouts** than Shopney apps. The builder is less flexible, and you have fewer options for creative layouts.

**Pros:**

* **Live Selling:** Strong features for live video commerce.
* **Affordable:** Great entry-level pricing for smaller merchants.
* **Easy Setup:** You can go live very quickly.

**Cons:**

* Limited design customization compared to more premium tools.
* UX can feel basic relative to higher-end competitors.
* Hands-on support and strategic guidance are typically strongest on higher-tier plans.

## 5. Custom Agency Development

**Best for:** Global enterprises (Nike, Zara) with unique, non-commerce requirements (AR, VR, complex gamification).

Strictly speaking, the "ultimate" alternative to a builder like Shopney is to build it yourself (or hire an agency). This is the traditional route: hiring a dev shop to code a native iOS app in Swift and an Android app in Kotlin from scratch.

### The Reality Check

For 99% of Shopify merchants, this is a bad idea.

Building a custom native app typically costs **$50,000 to $150,000+ upfront** and takes 6–9 months. But the real killer is maintenance. Every time Shopify updates their API, or Apple changes iOS, you have to pay developers to update your app. You become a software company, not just a brand.

The *only* reason to do this is if you need features that are impossible on the web—like complex Augmented Reality (AR) experiences, heavy 3D gaming, or hardware integration (Bluetooth-connected devices).

For everyone else, a solution like MobiLoud gives you **90% of that "custom" feel for a fraction of the cost and 0% of the ongoing headache.**

**Pros:**

* Massive flexibility—if you can design and code it, you can have it.
* Total ownership of the source code and architecture.

**Cons:**

* **Extremely Expensive:** High upfront build costs and ongoing maintenance.
* **Slow Time-to-Market:** Months vs. weeks.
* **Maintenance Burden:** You are responsible for keeping up with API, OS, and device-level changes.

## FAQs

### Is Shopney free?

Shopney is not free, but they do offer a 30-day free trial. Their pricing starts at a monthly fee for basic features, with many advanced integrations or capabilities available on higher-tier plans.

### Can I switch from Shopney to MobiLoud?

Yes, absolutely. Many clients switch from block-based builders like Shopney or Tapcart because they want to unlock their custom web features in a fully branded app. We handle the entire migration process for you, including app setup and app store submissions, and ensure a smooth transition for your existing app users.

### Does a mobile app improve conversion rates?

Yes—but the impact goes beyond a simple conversion rate bump.

Mobile apps typically **drive higher revenue per user** because your best customers come back more often, browse more deeply, and face fewer distractions than on the mobile web. Features like push notifications also drive higher engagement—with click-through rates often [exceeding 3%](https://www.pushwoosh.com/blog/push-notification-benchmarks/) in the retail sector, far outperforming email. The real win is in **repeat purchases, retention, and lifetime value (LTV)** rather than just a one-time conversion lift.

## Final Thoughts

Shopney is a great tool for what it is—a design-forward, entry-level app builder. If you are just starting out and need a simple, beautiful app to send push notifications, it is a worthy choice.

But as you scale, your app needs to do more than just look good. It needs to sell. It needs to retain. It needs to embody your unique brand experience, not a template shared by thousands of others—and it needs to do that without forcing you into rigid blocks, integration limits, or revenue share.

We take the high-converting mobile site you’ve already built and transform it into a world-class retention channel—without rebuilding, without extra tech debt, and without revenue share.
