# Klaviyo vs HubSpot: Which Email Marketing Platform is Right for Your Ecommerce Brand?

## Key Takeaways

Klaviyo and HubSpot approach ecommerce email marketing from different angles. Klaviyo is purpose-built for online retail with deep product-level segmentation and predictive analytics. HubSpot's Marketing Hub combines email with content management and inbound marketing tools. For stores focused on email and SMS automation, Klaviyo delivers specialized depth. For brands building comprehensive content strategies, HubSpot provides integrated tools. Both work seamlessly with mobile apps, with Klaviyo offering native push notification integration through MobiLoud.

## Introduction

[Marketing automation delivers $5.44 in ROI for every $1 invested](https://www.thunderbit.com/blog/marketing-automation-statistics/), making it one of the highest-return activities for ecommerce brands and DTC stores. But choosing between platforms gets complicated when you're comparing a specialist versus a generalist.

If you're evaluating Klaviyo and HubSpot, you're deciding between two fundamentally different tools. Klaviyo was built exclusively for ecommerce, turning customer data into revenue through email and SMS. HubSpot built its Marketing Hub as part of an integrated platform combining email with content marketing, landing pages, and CRM.

This guide compares how they stack up for ecommerce email marketing across features, automation, pricing, and integration — so you can choose the platform that fits your online store’s strategy.

## Klaviyo: Purpose-Built for Ecommerce

Klaviyo is an email and SMS platform designed specifically for online retailers, with deep integrations into Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, and Magento.

### Ecommerce-Native Email Features

Klaviyo's email engine syncs product and customer data in real time:

* Abandoned cart flows with dynamic product images and pricing
* Post-purchase sequences adapting to what customers bought
* Browse abandonment triggered by specific product views
* Win-back campaigns targeting predicted churn risk
* Back-in-stock alerts tied to inventory management

[Segmented campaigns drive a 760% increase in revenue](https://www.sender.net/blog/email-segmentation-statistics/) compared to generic sends. Klaviyo's segmentation layers purchase frequency, lifetime value, product affinity, and dozens of ecommerce-specific attributes updating in real time.

### Predictive Analytics and CRM

Klaviyo recently added CRM features focused on ecommerce retention:

* Automated forecasting for next purchase date and lifetime value
* Churn risk flagging before customers go quiet
* Customer profiles unified across email, SMS, and purchase behavior
* Revenue tracking and cohort analysis built for repeat purchases

Klaviyo's CRM answers one question: how do we maximize customer lifetime value through email and SMS for an online store?

### Pricing and Learning Curve

Klaviyo's contact-based pricing:

* Free: up to 250 profiles
* 500 contacts: $20/month
* 10,000 contacts: $150/month
* SMS billed separately based on usage

The trade-off is a steeper learning curve. Klaviyo rewards data-savvy marketers but can feel overwhelming for teams new to advanced segmentation and behavior-based flows.

## HubSpot: Integrated Marketing Platform

HubSpot's Marketing Hub is a comprehensive platform where email sits alongside content creation, landing pages, and inbound marketing tools.

### Email Marketing with Content Tools

HubSpot's email capabilities integrate with broader marketing features:

* Email automation with CRM integration
* Contact personalization using lifecycle stages and properties
* Multi-step workflows combining email with forms and landing pages
* A/B testing with smart send-time optimization
* Ecommerce platform integrations for cart and purchase data

For ecommerce brands, this means you can capture new subscribers through content (guides, quizzes, buying guides), route them into segmented lists, and then nurture them with product-focused email sequences and promotional campaigns.

HubSpot integrates with Shopify and WooCommerce to access order data for abandoned cart and post-purchase campaigns. The integration works for basic ecommerce flows but lacks Klaviyo's granular product-level tracking and merchandising flexibility.

### Content and Inbound Marketing

Where HubSpot differentiates is connecting email to your entire marketing operation:

* Content management system for blogs and landing pages
* SEO recommendations and optimization tools
* Lead capture forms and pop-ups
* Social media scheduling
* Marketing automation across multiple channels

For ecommerce, this is powerful if you're running content-heavy strategies — such as product education blogs, buying guides, comparison pages, or lead magnets like discount-gated guides and lookbooks. You can trigger ecommerce email sequences when someone reads a category guide, downloads a style guide, or views a key product page, not just when they place an order.

HubSpot keeps everything in one system so your campaigns, content, and email nurturing are unified around the same contact records and reporting.

### Pricing and Tiers

HubSpot's hub-based pricing:

* Free CRM with basic email tools
* Starter: $20/month (up to 1,000 contacts)
* Professional: $800/month (includes advanced automation)
* Enterprise: $3,600/month
* Professional and Enterprise require onboarding fees ($3,000–7,000)

[75% of businesses use marketing automation in 2024](https://www.inbeat.agency/marketing-automation-statistics/), and HubSpot is widely adopted as an all-in-one platform. From an ecommerce email perspective, that means you’re often paying for a broad set of content, landing page, and CRM capabilities on the Professional tier — which makes sense if you’ll fully leverage those tools, but can be overkill if your primary focus is email and SMS revenue.

## Head-to-Head Comparison

### Automation Capabilities

Klaviyo wins on ecommerce automation depth. Flows are real-time, behavior-driven, and built around product catalogs and purchase patterns. Conditional splits based on cart value, product views, and predictive data let you personalize at scale.

HubSpot's automation is powerful but designed for broader marketing contexts. Pre-built workflows make setup fast, but you'll hit limits on ecommerce-specific customization compared to Klaviyo, especially for multi-step merchandising flows and granular product triggers.

### Segmentation Precision

Klaviyo's segmentation is surgical with real-time updates. Layer purchase history, browsing behavior, predicted lifetime value, and custom attributes for hyper-targeted audiences — for example, high-LTV customers who’ve bought from a specific collection but haven’t purchased in the last 60 days.

HubSpot offers solid contact-based segmentation using CRM properties and engagement data. It works well for content marketing and lead nurturing but lacks Klaviyo's ecommerce-specific depth around product affinity, replenishment behavior, and purchase prediction.

### CRM & Data Model

Klaviyo’s CRM is narrow but deep for ecommerce. It’s built around orders, products, and lifetime value, giving you a data model optimized for repeat purchases, merchandising, and retention. Every email, SMS, and segment is closely tied to what people browse and buy.

HubSpot’s CRM is broader and more general-purpose. It’s ideal if you’re managing multiple contact types and touchpoints — such as partner leads, wholesale inquiries, or event registrations — in addition to ecommerce customers. For a pure online store, though, that breadth is less critical than Klaviyo’s opinionated focus on ecommerce revenue and CLV.

### Analytics and Revenue Attribution

Klaviyo focuses on revenue attribution and customer lifetime value. See exactly which emails drive sales, how segments perform over time, and where customers drop off in flows. It’s designed so ecommerce marketers can quickly answer questions like “Which flows drive the most repeat purchases?” and “Which segments are most profitable?”

HubSpot provides comprehensive marketing analytics tying email to overall customer journey. You'll get standard email metrics plus attribution across content, forms, and landing pages. It’s less ecommerce-specific than Klaviyo but more holistic for brands treating email as one part of a larger inbound marketing engine.

### Integration Strategy

Klaviyo integrates deeply with ecommerce platforms, syncing complete product catalogs, real-time inventory, browsing behavior, and purchase history. It becomes an extension of your store's database with 350+ ecommerce-focused integrations.

HubSpot supports 1,500+ integrations across marketing, analytics, and business tools. For ecommerce brands with more complex stacks — subscriptions, loyalty programs, review platforms, support tools, and analytics — this breadth can help unify data across more than just your storefront. Ecommerce integrations work for basic flows but don't match Klaviyo's real-time, product-level data sync.

### Ease of Use

HubSpot is easier to learn with an intuitive interface designed for speed. Launch campaigns in minutes without diving deep into documentation, which can be helpful for smaller teams or stores just getting started with automation.

Klaviyo requires more upfront investment to understand segmentation and flow logic. But that complexity translates into significantly more control for ecommerce use cases, especially once you’re building advanced flows around catalogs, replenishment, and high-LTV cohorts.

## Which Should You Choose?

### Choose Klaviyo If:

* You run an ecommerce or DTC business where email and SMS are core revenue drivers
* Advanced product-level segmentation and behavioral triggers matter to your retention strategy
* You want predictive analytics and revenue attribution built in
* Your team is marketing-focused and doesn't need content management tools
* Email automation is your primary retention channel and you want it tightly tied to purchase behavior

### Choose HubSpot If:

* You're building a content-heavy marketing strategy alongside email
* You need integrated landing pages, blog tools, and SEO capabilities to attract and nurture subscribers
* Your team wants one platform for all marketing activities and reporting
* You're managing lead generation through content downloads and educational campaigns as well as ecommerce
* You value unified reporting across email, content, social, and ads

## Integrating with Your Mobile App

Good news: both [Klaviyo](https://www.mobiloud.com/integrations/klaviyo) and [HubSpot](https://www.mobiloud.com/integrations/hubspot) work seamlessly with mobile apps through MobiLoud — and Klaviyo offers something extra.

MobiLoud converts your existing ecommerce website into native iOS and Android apps without rebuilding anything. Because your app is your website wrapped in a native container, everything already on your site — including Klaviyo or HubSpot — works automatically.

Your automations keep running. Your segments stay intact. Your flows, campaigns, and revenue tracking continue working exactly as they do on your website. No migration, no rebuilding, no learning curve. Outside of push, the core of both platforms — email, automations, and CRM features — work in your MobiLoud app exactly as they do on your site.

### Klaviyo's Native Push Integration

Here's where Klaviyo offers a unique advantage: **MobiLoud has a native integration with Klaviyo that lets you manage push notifications directly through your Klaviyo flows**.

Instead of learning a separate push platform, you can:

* Add push notifications to existing Klaviyo automation flows
* Send targeted push to the same segments you use for email
* Manage email, SMS, and push all from one platform
* Track revenue attribution for push alongside other channels

This integration means your entire retention strategy lives in Klaviyo. Build flows combining email, SMS, and push based on customer behavior — all managed through the platform you're already using.

The combination of [email, SMS, and push notifications](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/email-sms-push-marketing) creates a complete engagement system. Email delivers depth, SMS breaks through with urgency, and [push notifications for ecommerce](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/push-notifications-for-ecommerce) give you direct access to customers' home screens.

Mobile apps aren't just another channel — they're an owned asset. And because MobiLoud works with your entire stack, you're adding this advantage without disrupting what's already driving revenue.

## Final Thoughts

Klaviyo and HubSpot are both excellent platforms built for different ecommerce marketing strategies.

**Klaviyo** is the better choice for ecommerce brands and DTC stores focused on maximizing [customer lifetime value](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/how-to-increase-customer-lifetime-value-ecommerce) through specialized email and SMS automation. If revenue from repeat customers is your primary metric and you want deep product-level personalization, Klaviyo delivers.

**HubSpot** makes sense for brands building comprehensive content strategies where email is one piece of a larger acquisition and nurturing operation. If you're running an active blog, creating landing pages, and want everything unified under one platform, HubSpot provides that integration — especially if your ecommerce brand relies heavily on content to drive discovery and list growth.

For most traditional ecommerce brands (single storefront, DTC focus, transactional email emphasis), Klaviyo's specialization wins. For brands with complex content marketing needs and broader inbound strategies, HubSpot's breadth may justify the investment.

And if you're serious about retention and building owned channels, a mobile app should be part of your strategy. [Mobile apps deliver measurable ROI](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/ecommerce-mobile-app-roi) by turning one-time buyers into repeat customers.

Your app works with whatever email platform you choose — Klaviyo, HubSpot, or anything else. With Klaviyo specifically, you get the benefit of managing push notifications directly through your existing flows.

MobiLoud converts your existing website into native iOS and Android apps without rebuilding or changing your stack. Everything syncs automatically, and you get push notifications, app-exclusive features, and a permanent presence on your customers' devices.

### Does HubSpot work well for ecommerce email marketing?

Yes, but with limitations. HubSpot integrates with major ecommerce platforms and supports standard flows like abandoned cart and post-purchase emails.

HubSpot works best for brands running significant content marketing strategies alongside email.

### Which platform has better automation for online stores?

Klaviyo has significantly better automation specifically for ecommerce.

### Is HubSpot more expensive than Klaviyo?

Generally yes for email-focused ecommerce marketing. Klaviyo starts at $20/month and scales with contact count, with all features available at every tier. HubSpot's advanced features require Professional tier ($800/month) or Enterprise ($3,600/month) plus onboarding fees. For stores primarily focused on email and SMS revenue, Klaviyo is more cost-effective.
