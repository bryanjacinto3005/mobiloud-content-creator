## Side-by-Side: Where They Differ

### Automation Depth vs. Ease of Use

Klaviyo offers deeper automation with complex conditional logic and real-time triggers. Omnisend prioritizes speed with pre-built workflows and drag-and-drop simplicity.

[Automated emails generate up to 320% more revenue than one-off campaigns](https://www.salesso.com/blog/ecommerce-email-marketing-statistics/). Both platforms deliver, but Klaviyo gives precision while Omnisend gives approachability.

### Segmentation Power

Klaviyo's segmentation is granular with real-time updates, predictive data, and layered conditions. Omnisend offers solid segmentation but less flexibility. The gap matters for brands optimizing hyper-targeted campaigns.

### Channel Strategy

Klaviyo is email-first with SMS as an add-on (separate pricing). Omnisend is omnichannel by design—email, SMS, and push unified from the start. For coordinated multichannel campaigns, Omnisend is simpler.

### Analytics and Reporting

Klaviyo emphasizes revenue attribution and customer lifetime value. See which emails drive sales, how segments perform, and where customers drop off.

[Email marketing delivers an average ROI of $36-42 for every $1 spent](https://www.mailerlite.com/blog/email-marketing-roi). Klaviyo's analytics show exactly where that return comes from.

Omnisend offers clear dashboards with core metrics—opens, clicks, conversions, revenue. Advanced reporting is available on higher tiers. Less granular than Klaviyo, but easier to digest.

### Integrations

Klaviyo: 350+ native integrations plus robust API. Omnisend: 160+ integrations with one-click ecommerce setup. Both cover essential tools, but Klaviyo offers broader connectivity.
