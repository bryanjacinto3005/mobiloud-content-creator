> **Examples**: "Klaviyo vs MailChimp" | "Yotpo vs Judge.me" | "Gorgias vs Zendesk"

## Goal and Guiding Principle

- Provide an up-to-date, informative, fact-based breakdown of two platforms.
- Help readers choose the right tool for their specific needs.
- Introduce MobiLoud organically as a solution that works with both platforms.
- Guiding principle:
  - Focus on clarity and usefulness, not persuading the reader toward one tool or another.

## Strategic Purpose

These articles serve two key objectives:

1. **SEO Traffic**
   - Capture search traffic from our ICP (mid-market/enterprise ecommerce brands doing $2M+ in annual revenue).
   - The tools featured are likely already in use or being considered by our target customers.
   - Write with this sophisticated audience in mind.

2. **MobiLoud Awareness**
   - Demonstrate that both platforms work seamlessly with MobiLoud.
   - Highlight MobiLoud's key value proposition: works with any tool, app, plugin, or integration.
   - Unlike other app builders, we don't rely on limited supported integrations.

## Core Content Principles

### 1 — Reader-Centric Information

Think from the reader's perspective:

- What information do they need to make an informed decision?
- What features and capabilities matter most to them?
- What trade-offs should they consider?

We're not just listing features side by side—we're helping guide their decision with context and insight.

### 2 — Ecommerce Focus

Remember the audience:

- Write specifically for ecommerce brands.
- Many tools serve multiple business types (SaaS, services, in-store, etc.).
- Approach comparisons from an ecommerce angle.
- Highlight features and capabilities most relevant to online retail.

### 3 — Content Quality and Presentation

These topics face more competition:

- Create better content to win in search rankings.
- This can mean:
  - Unique content.
  - More in-depth analysis.
  - **Clearer presentation** (where most competitors fail).
- Make content easy to read, easy to scan, and easy to understand.
