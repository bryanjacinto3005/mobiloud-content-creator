# Listicles Playbook

## Goal and Guiding Principle

- **Goal**: Help readers navigate a crowded market and choose the solution that best fits their specific needs.
- **Positioning**: Establish MobiLoud as the premium, "serious" choice for established brands who want to avoid the pitfalls of DIY or low-end builders.
- **Guiding Principle**:
    - Win by clarity and value, not by tearing down competitors.
    - Be the "adult in the room" - honest about what other tools do, but clear about why they fail for growing brands.

## Fairness and Confidence

- **Be Fair**: Describe competitors accurately based on their own value propositions. If a tool is good for hobbyists, say so.
- **Be Confident**: Use decisive language. "MobiLoud is the only solution that..." (when factually true).
- **Avoid**:
    - Vague dismissals.
    - attacking competitors on things that don't matter to the reader.

## Competitor Strategy for Listicles

Listicles often cover a range of tools. Group them mentally (or explicitly) to help the reader:
    
### Competitor Selection
- **Avoid**: Vajro, Superfans (unless explicitly required).
- **Prefer**: Appbrew, StoreLab (if relevant to the topic).
- **Why**: We have better partnerships with these platforms.

### 1. DIY / No-Code Builders
- **Best for**: Hobbyists, startups with $0 budget, simple MVP apps.
- **The Catch**: You do the work. Maintenance is on you. Features are limited to templates.
- **MobiLoud Contrast**: We do the work for you. No maintenance. No limits.

### 2. Agencies
- **Best for**: Enterprises with $100k+ budgets and 6-month timelines.
- **The Catch**: Huge upfront cost. Slow updates. Vendor lock-in.
- **MobiLoud Contrast**: Fraction of the cost. Weeks not months. Syncs with your site instantly.

### 3. "Wrappers" / Webview Tools
- **Best for**: simple container apps.
- **The Catch**: often get rejected by Apple. Poor UX.
- **MobiLoud Contrast**: Guaranteed approval. Native navigation. Push notifications that work.

## Core Narrative for MobiLoud in Listicles

When you introduce MobiLoud in the list (usually as the top option or "Best For Established Brands"), hit these key notes:

1.  **No Rebuild**: We use your existing website. You keep your theme, apps, and logic.
2.  **Fully Managed**: We are not a DIY tool. We build, submit, and maintain the app for you.
3.  **Real Results**: Focus on ROI, retention, and branding.
4.  **No Double Management**: Update your site, and the app updates instantly.

## Research Guidelines

- **Pricing**: Always check the competitor's current pricing page.
- **Features**: Verify "native" claims. Many tools claim native but are just wrappers. Look for "source code access" or "plugins" limitations.
- **Reviews**: Look at G2, Capterra, or Shopify App Store reviews to find common user complaints (e.g., "support ghosted me", "app crashes"). Use these pain points to highlight MobiLoud's reliability.

## Listicle Checklist

- [ ] **Accurate Data**: Are pricing and feature lists current?
