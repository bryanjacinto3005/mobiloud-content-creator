# Guest Post Playbook

## Goal and Guiding Principle

- **Goal**: Create concise, valuable, and non-promotional content that fits naturally on a partner's website.
- **Guiding Principle**: 
    - Focus on value for the reader.
    - Mention MobiLoud briefly and naturally, not as a sales pitch.
    - Include internal links to the partner's other articles where relevant to build SEO value for them.
    - Be the helpful expert, not the aggressive salesperson.

## Voice and Style Guidelines

### Voice: Strategic Operator
- **Strategic operator voice**: Written like someone who understands ecommerce growth levers (retention, LTV, CAC payback) and is optimizing for outcomes, not theory.
- **Confident and directive**: Clear assertions and recommendations, minimal hedging, no “maybe” language unless it’s a real constraint (e.g., push opt-in).
- **Reader-forward (“you”) framing**: Speaks directly to the merchant/team and their constraints, using practical language over abstract marketing talk.
- **Retention-first lens**: Consistently brings ideas back to repeat purchases, habit, and post-purchase loops, not “having an app” for vanity.

### Style Approach
- **Problem → mechanism → payoff**: Each section explains the friction/problem, how the app changes the mechanism, and what it means for the business.
- **Skimmable structure**: Short paragraphs, frequent subheads, bulleted lists, and bold micro-sections so a busy operator can scan and still get value.
- **Action-oriented micro-playbooks**: “How to apply it” blocks convert concepts into next steps without turning the article into an SOP.
- **Practical comparisons without vendor bashing**: When describing options (custom, DIY, website-to-app), it stays grounded in tradeoffs: cost, time, maintenance, parity.
- **Low-fluff, no hype**: Avoids big promises and “guaranteed” claims. Uses measured language where needed, but keeps momentum and clarity.
- **Product mention as a natural implementation path**: Light, integrated, and positioned as an example of a category, not a hard sell.

## Core Structure for Guest Posts

Most guest posts will follow a structure that moves from "Why this matters" to "How to do it" and finally "Implementation options".

### 1. Set the Context (The "Why")
- **Purpose**: Explain why this topic matters right now without being overly negative ("doom-and-gloom").
- **Key Elements**:
    - Rising costs (CAC), shrinking margins.
    - The need for specific outcomes (retention, loyalty, efficiency).
    - Why traditional channels (Email, SMS) are crowded or insufficient on their own.

### 2. Structural Advantages
- **Purpose**: Explain *why* the solution (e.g., a Mobile App) solves the problem structurally.
- **Key Points**:
    - "Presence" on the home screen.
    - Reduced friction (always logged in, biometric checkout).
    - Different user behavior (data-backed higher engagement/spend).

### 3. Concrete Examples (The "How")
- **Purpose**: provide realistic, actionable examples of the strategy in action.
- **Examples**:
    - **VIP Access**: Early access to drops, exclusive SKUs (rewards commitment).
    - **Launch Strategy**: App-first launches (builds momentum).
    - **Push Notifications**: Personalized, relevant re-engagement (back in stock, price drops) rather than generic spam.
    - **Content**: Habit-building content (editorials, buying guides) to keep users engaged between purchases.

### 4. Ecosystem Fit
- **Purpose**: Show how the app complements existing channels (Email, SMS) rather than replacing them.
- **Message**: Apps are for your most loyal customers, not necessarily your entire list.

### 5. Implementation Options (The MobiLoud Mention)
- **Purpose**: Inform about how to build the solution.
- **Guideline**: 
    - Keep it short. No feature lists, pricing tables, or aggressive CTAs.
    - Present options honestly:
        - **Custom Dev**: Highest performance/customization, highest cost/time. Best for big budgets.
        - **DIY Builders**: Good for simple MVP, low budget. High effort for the merchant.
        - **Web-to-App (MobiLoud)**: Best for brands happy with their site who want low friction, consistency, and reduced maintenance. Uses existing stack.
    - **Positioning**: "Modern ecommerce apps don’t require rebuilding your store. Platforms like MobiLoud let brands launch native apps powered directly by their existing site."

## Example Outlines

### Example A: Loyalty and Retention Focus (e.g., for Koin)
**Title**: How to Build Loyalty and Retention with a Mobile App

1.  **Why Loyalty is Hard**: Rising CAC, crowded inboxes. Retention is about habit.
2.  **Why Apps work**: Home screen presence, reduced friction.
3.  **How to Build Loyalty** (Examples):
    - App-only access (VIP treatment).
    - App-first product launches.
    - Personalized push notifications (utility, not ads).
    - Loyalty program integration (visible points).
4.  **Complementing Email/SMS**: Apps for deep relationships, Email for storytelling, SMS for urgency.
5.  **Launching without Reinventing**: Mention that modern apps can leverage the existing website (MobiLoud approach) to preserve consistency and lower cost.

### Example B: Tech/Platform Focus (e.g., for Qikify/Shopify Plus)
**Title**: How to Turn Your Shopify Plus Store into a Mobile App

1.  **Why a Mobile App?**: Brief intro on the value (retention, conversion). Mention unique challenges for Shopify Plus (custom features).
2.  **Options to Build**: Compare honestly.
    - **Custom Development**: Pros (unlimited customizability), Cons (high cost, slow). Target: Big budget, specific custom needs.
    - **DIY Builders**: Pros (cheap), Cons (templates, manual effort). Target: Small brands, lower customization needs.
    - **Web-to-App Services (MobiLoud)**: Pros (keeps distinct web features, low maintenance, fast), Cons (mirrors web experience). Target: Brands happy with their site, want efficiency.
3.  **Conclusion**: Choose the path that fits the resource level and goals.
