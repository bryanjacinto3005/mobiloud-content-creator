# Use Case Articles Playbook

## Goal and Guiding Principle

- **Goal**: Help users on specific web platforms (e.g., Shopware, Spryker, Bubble, Webflow) understand why building a mobile app is difficult and how MobiLoud offers a superior alternative.
- **Guiding Principle**:
  - Demonstrate deep empathy for the nuances of their specific platform.
  - Position MobiLoud not just as a generic tool, but as the *only* viable solution that respects their unique tech stack.
  - "Keep your stack, get the app."
  - **The User Lens**: Write from the perspective of a user *running* this platform. Use their language, their worries, and their goals. Don't sound like an outsider observing the platform; sound like an expert insider who uses it daily.

## The Core Narrative


1.  **The Specific Problem (The Challenge)**:
    - Explain why standard app builders fail (e.g., they can't handle custom plugins, headless setups, or complex workflows).
    - Explain why custom development is too expensive/risky.

2.  **The "Ah-ha" Moment**:
    - The best way to build an app is *not* to rebuild, but to *wrap* the existing perfected web experience.

3.  **The MobiLoud Promise**:
    - Complete feature parity (because it's the website).
    - Real-time sync.
    - Zero additional maintenance.
    - Verified App Store approval.

## Tone and Style

- **Authoritative**: You must sound like you understand the specific platform (e.g., mentioning specific ecosystem terms like "plugins" vs "apps" vs "modules").
- **Insider/Peer**: Write as a peer, not a salesperson. "We know how annoying X is on [Platform]" is better than "Mobiloud solves X".
- **Empathetic**: Acknowledge the pain of maintaining two codebases.
- **Direct**: Avoid fluff. Get straight to the technical reality.

### Avoiding the "Cookie-Cutter" Trap
To ensure articles don't sound identical:
1.  **Vary the Vocabulary**: Use the platform's specific lexicon (e.g., "merchants" vs "sellers", "storefront" vs "site").
2.  **Tune the Vibe**:
    *   *B2B/Enterprise*: Serious, efficient, ROI-focused.
    *   *Lifestyle/DTC*: Energetic, brand-focused, customer-centric.
    *   *Dev-First*: Technical, architectural, precise.
3.  **Inject Specifics**: Mention specific plugins, popular themes, or common tech stack combinations that are unique to that ecosystem.

## Language and Clarity Guidelines

- **Use Straightforward Terms**: Avoid needless synonyms. Use simple, clear terms like "store", "site", or "business" instead of "operation", "entity", or "commerce implementation".
- **Avoid Vague Language**: Be specific and clear. Instead of vague phrases like "take mobile" or "mobile-first approach", use clear language like "launch a mobile app" or "turn your site into an app".
- **Speak Directly to the Reader**: Use "you" and direct address. Instead of "teams commonly rely on" say "If you're on [Platform], you rely on". Make it personal and relevant.
- **Use Simple Language Over Jargon**: Avoid terms like "system of record" or "reflects the workflows". Use plain language that anyone can understand.
- **Be Direct, Not Tentative**: Use "requires" instead of "tends to require". Be confident and clear.
- **Avoid Hedging Language**: Cut words like "likely", "usually", "most", "many", "typically", "often" wherever possible. They make content sound less convincing and more AI-like. Instead of "you've likely invested", say "you've invested". Instead of "this usually takes", say "this takes". Be direct and confident.

## Research Requirements

Before writing, you must research the target platform to answer:
- Does it have a native mobile solution? (Usually no, or it's very basic).
- What do users call extensions? (Plugins, Add-ons, Apps, Modules).
- What is the biggest pain point? (Cost, Complexity, Headless structure).
- Name-check specific competitors or "old ways" if relevant (e.g. "PWA", "PhoneGap").
- For niche platforms: What template/app builders exist? (Usually none specific, only general-purpose tools like Thunkable, FlutterFlow).

## Explaining MobiLoud (CRITICAL)

This is the most important part of the article. You must clearly explain what MobiLoud is and how it works.

### What to Emphasize

- **MobiLoud is a Managed Service**: This is the #1 selling point. We do everything for the customer - no development lift, no change to their workflow.
- **What It Actually Is**: A fully managed service that converts existing websites into native apps using a hybrid app approach.
- **How It Works**: The customer's existing site is the core of the app, with native UI elements layered on top (tab menu, navigation, splash screens).
- **The Process**: Our team of experts handles everything - configuration, design optimization, App Store/Google Play publishing, and ongoing maintenance.

### What to Avoid

- Don't dance around it with vague language like "website-to-app approach" or "reflects your workflows" without explaining what that means.
- Don't assume readers understand what a "hybrid app" is - explain it clearly.
- Don't make it sound like the customer has to build or configure things themselves.

## Structure & Headings (IMPORTANT)

- **Do Not Copy/Paste Headings**: The `use_case_structure.md` file provides *inspiration*, not rigid commandments.
- **Be Creative**: "The Challenge" is a boring heading. "Why Custom [Platform] Apps Break the Bank" is better.
- **Find the Angle**: Every platform has a unique vibe.
    - *Elastic Path* is "Composable". Use that word.
    - *Medusa* is "Headless/Developer-First". Use that.
    - *Bubble* is "No-Code". Use that.

## Checklist

- [ ] Does the intro cite specific stats or context about the platform?
- [ ] Do we clearly explain why "Generic App Builders" fail for this specific platform?
- [ ] Is the terminology correct for the platform?
- [ ] **User Lens Check**: Does the article read like it was written by someone who actually runs a store on this platform?
- [ ] Most importantly, does the article emphasize that the user keeps their underlying tech stack?
- [ ] **Are the headings unique/tailored? (Not just generic "Goal" "Solution" titles)**.
- [ ] Is there a clear path to a Demo/Preview?
