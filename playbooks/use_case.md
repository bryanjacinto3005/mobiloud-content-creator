# Use Case Articles Playbook

## Goal and Guiding Principle

- **Goal**: Help users on specific web platforms (e.g., Shopware, Spryker, Bubble, Webflow) understand why building a mobile app is difficult and how MobiLoud offers a superior alternative.
- **Guiding Principle**:
  - Demonstrate deep empathy for the nuances of their specific platform.
  - Position MobiLoud not just as a generic tool, but as the *only* viable solution that respects their unique tech stack.
  - "Keep your stack, get the app."

## The Core Narrative

1.  **The Specific Problem**:
    - Acknowledge that the platform is great for web, but lacks a native mobile path.
    - Explain why standard app builders fail (e.g., they can't handle custom plugins, headless setups, or complex workflows).
    - Explain why custom development is too expensive/risky.

2.  **The "Ah-ha" Moment**:
    - The best way to build an app is *not* to rebuild, but to *wrap* the existing perfected web experience.

3.  **The MobiLoud Promise**:
    - Complete feature parity (because it's the website).
    - Real-time sync.
    - Zero additional maintenance.
    - Verified App Store approval.

## Tone and Style

- **Authoritative**: You must sound like you understand the specific platform (e.g., mentioning specific ecosystem terms like "plugins" vs "apps" vs "modules").
- **Empathetic**: Acknowledge the pain of maintaining two codebases.
- **Direct**: Avoid fluff. Get straight to the technical reality.

## Research Requirements

Before writing, you must research the target platform to answer:
- Does it have a native mobile solution? (Usually no, or it's very basic).
- What do users call extensions? (Plugins, Add-ons, Apps, Modules).
- What is the biggest pain point? (Cost, Complexity, Headless structure).
- Name-check specific competitors or "old ways" if relevant (e.g. "PWA", "PhoneGap").

## Structure & Headings (IMPORTANT)

- **Do Not Copy/Paste Headings**: The `use_case_structure.md` file provides *inspiration*, not rigid commandments.
- **Be Creative**: "The Challenge" is a boring heading. "Why Custom [Platform] Apps Break the Bank" is better.
- **Find the Angle**: Every platform has a unique vibe.
    - *Elastic Path* is "Composable". Use that word.
    - *Medusa* is "Headless/Developer-First". Use that.
    - *Bubble* is "No-Code". Use that.
- **Use "Feature Spotlights"**: If a platform is complex (like B2B or Composable), add a dedicated section explaining how we handle those specific complex features.

## Checklist

- [ ] Does the intro cite specific stats or context about the platform?
- [ ] Do we clearly explain why "Generic App Builders" fail for this specific platform?
- [ ] Is the terminology correct for the platform?
- [ ] Most importantly, does the article emphasize that the user keeps their underlying tech stack?
- [ ] **Are the headings unique/tailored? (Not just generic "Goal" "Solution" titles)**.
- [ ] Is there a clear path to a Demo/Preview?
